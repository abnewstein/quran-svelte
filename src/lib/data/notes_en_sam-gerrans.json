Arabic: <i>ra\u1e25m\u0101n</i> \u2014 generally translated <i>most merciful</i> and synonyms thereof which is understandable given modern usage of the word, and the fact that <i>ra\u1e25m\u0101n</i> shares the <i>r-\u1e25-m</i> root with <i>ra\u1e25\u012bm</i> which undoubtedly encompasses such senses. However, there are three arguments against such a Qur\u2019anic value for <i>ra\u1e25m\u0101n.</i> Firstly, there are certain Qur\u2019anic instances where context is at direct odds with the subject of mercy. Secondly, <i>ra\u1e25m\u0101n</i> appears alongside <i>ra\u1e25\u012bm</i> in the <i>bismillah</i> so were the Traditionalist right in his assessment of <i>ra\u1e25m\u0101n</i>, we must admit to a tautologous and therefore superfluous opening statement, which would be odd since the text in general is characterised by exactitude and economy of words. Thirdly, there is historical evidence of usage of <i>ra\u1e25m\u0101n</i> among Nabataean Arabs in the sense of <i>almighty</i> (in a eulogy chiselled in rock describing a king who had just defeated and laid waste his enemies). That <i>ra\u1e25m\u0101n</i> was used in this sense among the Nabataeans lends additional supports to the broader thesis that Mu\u1e25ammad was a Nabataean Arab \u2014 perhaps from Petra, but certainly with access to it as a place of pilgrimage (see Notepad XVI). However, in the present work, <i>ra\u1e25m\u0101n</i> is rendered <i>almighty</i> on the basis of pan-textual analysis (comparison of all instances and their contexts).

In English, they tend to be called the mysterious letters, since the default Traditionalist Islamic position is that their meaning may be understood by God alone. Traditionalist Islam has, however, in its 1,400-year history, furnished a number of theories as to their meaning, none of which is convincing, and some of which are highly contrived, insulting to the intelligence, or cases of meandering subjective mysticism. Rashad Khalifa and his principal adherent Edip Yuksel claim an understanding of their meaning on the basis of a broader system of Khalifa\u2019s devising predicated on the number 19. Leaving aside consideration of the relative merits of that system, the fact is that it requires the manipulation of the components of <em>al \u1e25ur\u016bf al muqa\u1e6d\u1e6da\u02bf\u0101t</em> to claim to work at all. In the first (e-book) edition of this work (2016) I stated frankly that I did not know what these letters mean. Having tried and failed to decipher them on more than one occasion, I had made peace with the fact that I would publish my life\u2019s work without an answer to this age-old question. However, as I was approaching the end of the process of correcting the text prior to the first \u2018rough\u2019 hard-copy release, I was privileged to gain the beginnings of a cohesive understanding of their meaning in response to prayer. I included those findings at that stage in my process in that initial hard copy release of my work in 2017. Since that time, I have \u2014 thanks to those individuals who backed me on the basis of that first release of <em>The Qur\u2019an: A Complete Revelation</em> \u2014 been funded through the equally mammoth task of finalising this work prior to what I hope to be its final edition (2021). I am delighted to be able to include within the present edition of my work a full and comprehensive exposition of the meanings of these symbols. Their demonstration is comprehensive, cohesive, and entirely consistent with the text, and \u2014 when understood \u2014 deeply impressive. However, it is not something one can summarise in a few words. The meaning of <em>al \u1e25ur\u016bf al muqa\u1e6d\u1e6da\u02bf\u0101t\u00a0</em>defeated the best minds the Islamic world has produced over the course of fourteen centuries; it is natural that it would require intelligence and concentration to follow their explanation. However, these factors being present, a full understanding of <em>al \u1e25ur\u016bf al muqa\u1e6d\u1e6da\u02bf\u0101t</em> may be gained in a few hours by the diligent student; and once gained, that student\u2019s engagement with \u2014 and appreciation of \u2014 the Qur\u2019an will be greatly enhanced. In the notes below, I furnish the value for each instance of <em>al \u1e25ur\u016bf al muqa\u1e6d\u1e6da\u02bf\u0101t</em>, along with a reference to this note and to <a>Article MLQ</a> where the interested reader may acquaint himself with their comprehensive exposition. <br/><em>alif l\u0101m m\u012bm:</em> <br/>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<a>1:1-7</a> (al f\u0101ti\u1e25ah)."], ["2:2:1", "1.

J. Arberry distinguishes himself among mainstream translators in that he correctly renders <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika that</i> (i.e. indicating what precedes). In the present work the order of the Qur\u2019an is taken to be as fixed and deliberate as that of its contents; thus <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> points back at and references that which precedes; namely, the letters <i>alif l\u0101m m\u012bm</i> and \u2014 via them \u2014 <i>al f\u0101ti\u1e25ah</i> (see note below)."], ["2:2:2", "2. <b>Qur\u2019anic definition</b>: <i>al kit\u0101bu l\u0101 rayba f\u012b hi</i>.

He is not clear whether the sense is: <i>This</i> <i>is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah</i> (Saheeh International) or <i>This</i> <i>is the Book; in it is guidance sure, without doubt, to those who fear Allah</i> (Yusuf Ali). He resolves his problem by declaring both readings valid and adding two sets of three dots to the Qur\u2019anic text to indicate alternate readings. The most basic application of pan-textual analysis shows that the same collocation as found at <a>2:2</a> is found also at <a>10:37</a> and <a>32:2</a> where it can <i>only</i> be parsed in the first way; and in accordance with the methodology here, that must be the correct parsing at <a>2:2</a> also. To consider <a>2:2</a> free of Traditionalist encumbrances then, we should recall that <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> indicates what directly precedes (see note above). The question is then: <i>what directly precedes</i> <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika here?</i> What <i>directly</i> precedes <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> here is the first instance of <i>al \u1e25ur\u016bf al muqa\u1e6d\u1e6da\u02bf\u0101t</i>, which in English transliteration is <i>alif l\u0101m m\u012bm</i>. For the statement here at <a>2:2</a> to be meaningful, <i>alif l\u0101m m\u012bm</i> must in some way signify values equal to <i>al f\u0101ti\u1e25ah.</i> And here our journey into understanding <i>al \u1e25ur\u016bf al muqa\u1e6d\u1e6da\u02bf\u0101t</i> begins (for the full analysis of <i>al \u1e25ur\u016bf al muqa\u1e6d\u1e6da\u02bf\u0101t</i> see <a>Article MLQ</a>.) We saw above that verses <a>1:1-7</a> comprise a suzerainty (or lord-vassal) treaty defining obligations and rights between parties. Familiarity with the broader text reveals that the Qur\u2019an itself serves two purposes: to confirm what is within its scope, and to give a detailed exposition of <i>al kit\u0101bu l\u0101 rayba f\u012b hi</i> (see <a>10:37</a>). Thus <i>al f\u0101ti\u1e25ah</i> comprises the quintessence of which the remaining Qur\u2019an is an exposition or working-out. In Arabic <i>kit\u0101b</i> refers to something written. That sense includes <i>contract</i> and synonyms thereof, and given what we have understood of <i>al f\u0101ti\u1e25ah,</i> the collocation under discussion is rendered here and throughout: <i>the Writ about which there is no doubt</i>.

The concept of <i>taqw\u0101</i> is often translated as <i>consciousness (of God)</i> or <i>piety</i>. I agree with that rendering insofar as it carries the connotation of circumspection and precautionary, preparatory \u2014 or anticipatory \u2014 awareness; yet it is missing two key components: the fact that such fear is <i>warranted</i> (one\u2019s duty is a real and pre-existing obligation; see <a>7:172</a>), and <i>action based thereon</i> (here: deeds in keeping with one\u2019s obligations, and spending of that which God has provided) which acts comprise evidence of piety. I render the verb <i>to be in prudent fear</i>; the participle <i>those of prudent fear</i>; <i></i>and the noun <i>prudent fear</i> throughout since this rendering achieves something of the two requirements just stated, as well as the initial sense of <i>fear</i> or <i>consciousness</i>. The possession and exercise of <i>taqw\u0101</i> is at the core of meaningful human experience (<a>2:21</a>), and something peculiar to humans who, alone in all Creation so far as we know, are capable of conceptual anticipation, and planning and action on the basis thereof.

Arabic: <i>al \u1e63al\u0101t</i>. As anyone with a background in the religion called Islam will appreciate, <i>al \u1e63al\u0101t</i> figures conspicuously in the Traditionalist\u2019s presentation of the Qur\u2019an, since the value he ascribes to it represents a central plank of the dogma he promotes \u2014 a dogma contrived elsewhere and then ascribed by him to the Qur\u2019an. The Traditionalist\u2019s narrative asserts that the broader collocation <i></i>here (a frequent motif in the Qur\u2019an) is an imperative to adhere to a formal prayer regime, the number of which and the form of which are together a creative product of the Traditionalist\u2019s preferred, non-Qur\u2019anic sources. <a>Article SZC</a> in the present work summarises the divergent ways that the Traditionalist treats <i>\u1e63al\u0101t</i>; how he is forced, here and there, to replace his preferred value in translations with other (completely unrelated) meanings where it is not possible to impress his required value upon the context since the result would be too bizarre, even for him. He practices this inconstancy with regard to the Qur\u2019an because his value for <i>al \u1e63al\u0101t</i> is a pre-requisite for any analysis he conducts; it is, as we say, an assumed conclusion which is conceived outside of the Qur\u2019an and then imported into it. Since his value for <i>al \u1e63al\u0101t</i> cannot be shown to arise organically in the text, it must be forced to fit in order to achieve his purpose: for his religion to appear intrinsic to the Qur\u2019an. While attentive readers with knowledge of Arabic feel an awkward tension at certain places where the term is found, those who have been thoroughly schooled in the Traditionalist\u2019s assumed conclusions assume he can prove his assertions. I do not make that assumption. On a pan-textual basis <i>\u1e63al\u0101t</i> is shown generically to denote <i>duty</i>. Its core sense is the duty both to serve and to seek help from God alone as per the Writ at <a>1:1-7</a> of which the statement at <a>1:5</a> comprises our part \u2014 commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every man has to acknowledge God\u2019s authority (see <a>7:172</a>). But every man has innumerable duties in his various capacities in life. God himself has duties. Of course, <i>\u1e63al\u0101t</i> may also indicate <i>worship</i> since worship is also a duty binding upon a believing man. But just because worship is a duty does not mean that all duty is worship just as, while all oranges are fruits, all fruits are not oranges. This simple point of logic has evaded the Traditionalist and resulted in a shambles, and the Islamic world is that shambles writ large, as countless millions of people are encouraged \u2014 under the auspices of the Traditionalist\u2019s priesthood \u2014 to be lax in the myriad duties which result in honest, productive, God-fearing families and societies, in favour of paying a time tax in (typically) meaningless rituals. The result is the systematic thwarting of potential and frustration of initiative, and finds broader expression in the corruption, ineptitude, intellectual torpidity, wasted lives, and inferior culture which characterise the Muslim world today and led to its collapse. I render <i>\u1e63al\u0101t</i> as <i>duty</i> throughout. Instances of <i>\u1e63al\u0101t</i> and its plural <i>\u1e63alaw\u0101t</i> appear in the notes and reference this verse.

Verses <a>2:8-20</a> focus upon a single term \u2014 <em>al k\u0101fir\u016bn \u2014</em> and, according to my analysis, define it. To claim <em>al k\u0101fir\u016bn</em> as <em>the unbelievers</em>, <em>the rejecters,</em> or <em>the infidels</em> as per the Traditionalist\u2019s contention may be right in a highly specialised sense, but that sense is now long lost. The Qur\u2019anic definition restores and revives the term fully. Of the terms defined in the first pages of <em>al baqarah</em> it is <em>al k\u0101fir\u016bn</em> which is treated most comprehensively; perhaps because it is precisely this category of person which is most pernicious and destructive. Verses <a>2:8-20</a>, then, comprehensively fix the correct definition of <em>al k\u0101fir\u016bn</em> which may be summarised (based on the Qur\u2019anic treatment) as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>they claim to believe in God when they are not among those who truly believe</li>\n<li>they try to deceive both God and those who do believe</li>\n<li>they are themselves deceived</li>\n<li>they are diseased in heart</li>\n<li>they create corruption in the land while failing to see that they do so</li>\n<li>they have contempt for the faith of the generality of mankind</li>\n<li>they claim to believe and side with those who believe in God but, in fact, side with the <em><u>sh</u></em><em>ay\u1e6d\u0101n</em>s; (that <em><u>sh</u></em><em>ay</em><em>\u1e6d\u0101n</em> treats of an adversary (against the command of God). see <a>Article SJC</a></li>\n<li>they are in possession of guidance yet reject it in favour of error</li>\n<li>they are blinded in darkness (due to the failure of the \u2018light\u2019 of their own making)</li>\n<li>the full power and majesty of true light puts them in fear of death</li>\n<li>their continued existence is by the grace of God alone</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Traditionalist\u2019s value of <em>the unbelievers</em>, <em>the rejecters,</em> or <em>the infidels</em> here, again, is not spectacularly wrong, but it is still wrong \u2014 and sufficiently wrong to matter. What the Traditionalist means by <em>al k\u0101fir\u016bn</em> \u2014 and what he wants the reader to infer \u2014 is <em>one who rejects the religion of Islam</em>. That religion is not native to the Qur\u2019an and God did not oblige men to follow the religion today known as Islam since the Qur\u2019an\u2019s own use of the word <em>isl\u0101m</em> and conceits applied to the term subsequently are irreconcilable. Rather, God obliges men to follow <em>guidance</em> if they receive it (<a>2:38</a>). The entire point about <em>al k\u0101fir\u016bn</em> is that they are possessed of guidance; however, they are distinct from <em>those who ignore warning</em> in that <em>al k\u0101fir\u016bn</em> claim to believe and claim to be guided. One of the Traditionalist\u2019s mistakes regarding this category of men is that he identifies <em>al k\u0101fir\u016bn</em> as an external group of deniers and rejecters. This is incorrect; this category of men is an internal group, an insidious force within. A point consistently missed but revealed by following the Qur\u2019anic definition is that <em>al k\u0101fir\u016bn</em> see themselves as righteous. They speak the language of religion and faith. But they refuse to follow guidance. Something close in English would be <em>self-righteous</em>; however, English is now degraded and this word has lost its primary meaning of <em>one wise in his own conceits over the guidance of God</em> and now means merely <em>opinionated and moralistic,</em> which sense is not equal to what is meant here. In the popular Christianised sense, <em>Pharisees</em> is close to what we are looking for. The word <em>hypocrites</em> also bears consideration, but is not fully correct. Generally, however, a hypocrite is just a toady: he pretends to believe what he does not; but he may or may not consider himself righteous. As defined by the Qur\u2019an, <em>al k\u0101fir\u016bn</em> are a very particular type of hypocrite: people who both reject guidance <em>and</em> consider themselves virtuous. In short: <em>al k\u0101fir\u016bn</em> believe themselves followers of guidance, while actually following something else. All things considered, <em>those who reject guidance while claiming virtue</em> acceptably summarises the core concept; in the present edition I render more tersely as <em>the false claimers of guidance</em> throughout where the word occurs as a discrete unit (taking no object), which is how it is found here.

Although there is not the least doubt that[...] the pronominal ma refers to earlier revelations, and particularly the Bible (as is evident from the parallel use of the above expression in other Qur</i>\u2019<i>anic passages), the idiomatic phrase ma bayna yadayhi does not, in itself, mean \u201cthat which came before it\u201d - i.e., in time - but, rather[...] \u201cthat which lies open before it\u201d. [...]Now this, taken together (a) with the fact - frequently stressed in the Qur</i>\u2019<i>an and since established by objective scholarship - that in the course of the millennia the Bible has been subjected to considerable and often arbitrary alteration, and (b) with the fact that many of the laws enunciated in the Qur</i>\u2019<i>an differ from the laws of the Bible, brings us forcibly to the conclusion that the \u201cconfirmation\u201d of the latter by the Qur</i>\u2019<i>an can refer only to the basic truths still discernible in the Bible, and not to its time-bound legislation or to its present text - in other words, a confirmation of whatever was extant of its basic teachings at the time of the revelation of the Qur</i>\u2019<i>an: and it is this that the phrase ma bayna yadayhi expresses in this context as well as in <a>5:46</a> and <a>5:48</a> or in <a>61:6</a> (where it refers to Jesus</i>\u2019 <i>confirming the truth of \u201cwhatever there still remained [i.e., in his lifetime] of the Torah\u201d).</i>"], ["2:66:2", "2.

On the basis of my own investigations this statement connects most convincingly with Deut. <a>21:1-9</a> wherein is found the Mosaic law in a case of unresolved murder. The procedure given there is for the elders of the town nearest the location of the discovered corpse to strike off the head of a heifer at the site, state what facts are known \u2014 namely that they are not guilty \u2014 and wash their hands. The mention of the use of reason at the end of <a>2:73</a> corresponds both to the use thereof by the elders at Deut. <a>21:1-9</a> and to the fact that God gives <i>\u2018life to the dead\u2019</i> and <i>\u2018demonstrates his proofs\u2019</i> to us thereby; just as cases of murder may be established and resolved by the application of evidence and reason, so the fact of our own death and life thereafter is established by the same means.

Neither the Qur</i>\u2019<i>an, nor any saying of the Prophet, nor even the Bible offers the slightest warrant for this highly imaginative explanation, which must, therefore, be rejected - quite apart from the fact that the pronoun hu in idribuhu has a masculine gender, while the noun nafs (here translated as \u201chuman being\u201d) is feminine in gender: from which it follows that the imperative idribuhu cannot possibly refer to nafs. On the other hand, the verb daraba (lit., \u201che struck\u201d) is very often used in a figurative or metonymic sense, as, for instance, in the expression daraba fi</i>\u2019<i>l-ard (\u201che journeyed on earth\u201d), or daraba</i> \u2019<i>sh-shay</i>\u2019 <i>bi</i>\u2019<i>sh-shay</i>\u2019 <i>(\u201che mixed one thing with another thing\u201d), or daraba mathal (\u201che coined a similitude\u201d or \u201cpropounded a parable\u201d or \u201cgave an illustration\u201d), or</i> \u2019<i>ala darb wahid (\u201csimilarly applied\u201d or \u201cin the same manner\u201d), or duribat</i> \u2019<i>alayhim adh-dhillah (\u201chumiliation was imposed on them\u201d or \u201capplied to them\u201d), and so forth. Taking all this into account, I am of the opinion that the imperative idribuhu occurring in the above Qur</i>\u2019<i>anic passage must be translated as \u201capply it\u201d or \u201cthis\u201d (referring, in this context, to the principle of communal responsibility). As for the feminine pronoun ha in ba</i>\u2019<i>diha (\u201csome of it\u201d), it must necessarily relate to the nearest preceding feminine noun - that is, to the nafs that has been murdered, or the act of murder itself about which (fiha) the community disagreed. Thus, the phrase idribuhu bi-ba</i>\u2019<i>diha may be suitably rendered as \u201capply this [principle] to some of those [cases of unresolved murder]\u201d: for it is obvious that the principle of communal responsibility for murder by a person or persons unknown can be applied only to some and not to all such cases.</i>"], ["2:73:2", "2.

Lane (p. 3039) has an excellent entry where he describes <i>bal</i> as primarily <i>a particle of digression[...] it denotes emendation wherever it occurs in the case of negation or of affirmation</i>. His comments go into some depth and explore the functions this particle performs in various contexts, and I refer the interested reader to those. I have been guided by Lane in terms of his analysis but not his usage in all cases. He was writing for a different time, and English has evolved since. However, by following Lane\u2019s explanation of the particle\u2019s function we can present a vehicle in the modern language for it. The primary function of <i>bal</i> is to interrupt narrative by means of negation or confirmation and then to digress (i.e. clarify along a new tack). The problem many translators have is that they use <i>nay \u2014</i> which performs only some portion of the total requirement. By clinging to it they put themselves in a position where they are trying, as it were, to play tennis with no forehand and from the baseline only. What is required is a set phrase which does what Lane states, namely: <i>denotes emendation wherever it occurs in the case of negation or of affirmation.</i> The use of <i>nay</i> manages only the case of negation, and not always very well. What is needed is something equal to: <i>be that as it may, the fact of the matter is[...]</i>. Such a phrase performs the offices which Lane describes and can function equally in cases of negation or affirmation. The shortest route I know of in modern English to achieve this value is: <i>the truth is,[...]</i> which means 1. <i>without doubt; certainly</i> and 2. <i>in reality</i>. This, then, is the default and commonest rendering of <i>bal</i> here. However, there exist also, as Lane explains, several discrete applications of this particle. I evaluate and render these on a case-by-case basis in the light of Lane\u2019s broader comments as: <i>nay, yet, but,</i> or <i>rather</i> depending on the case.

We tend to think of sorcery as something which defies the laws of so-called Nature; something fantastical, unnatural, and unhinged (often in a dark way) from what is real. While I do not wish to reject these connotations across the board, it is of note that sorcery features prominently among the accusations levelled against messengers by those who reject revelation (see examples at <a>10:2</a>, <a>11:7</a>, <a>28:48</a>, <a>37:15</a>, <a>38:4</a>, <a>43:30</a>, <a>46:7</a>). While the import in those cases may be thought of as something closer to <i>delusional</i> or <i>irrational</i> in modern English, we should bear in mind the following: M\u016bs\u0101 and H\u0101r\u016bn are accused of sorcery by Fir\u02bfawn \u2014 whose very rule is characterised by sorcery. For Fir\u02bfawn \u2014 and those tyrants for whom Fir\u02bfawn is the archetype \u2014 sorcery is the means by which power is maintained. And for such men, sorcery is the collective term for the manipulation of the masses via the dark arts. In our day, those arts result in myths created and installed in the mind of the population via education, media, entertainment, controlled science, controlled religion, and are supported by other means such as planned debt, ignorance, solipsism and sickness, as well as the wholesale drugging of society. Together, these deliver the levers of control into the hands of the dark state. When Fir\u02bfawn accuses M\u016bs\u0101 and H\u0101r\u016bn of sorcery, he is interpreting what he sees as a power-play by them against his regime via the prism of his understanding and experience of the mechanics of power, and naturally sees them as a threat to that power. Thus, he regards them as usurpers who wish to supplant his sorcery with their own. He fails to understand that while his methods are based on deception, trickery, and manipulation, M\u016bs\u0101 and H\u0101r\u016bn are bringing real proofs from God (see <a>10:77</a>)."], ["2:102:7", "7.

Where a word has developed a range of senses, invariably those senses have emerged from a single core concept. The Traditionalist translator tends simply to pick whatever best suits the purposes of trying to create a connection between his religion and the contents of the Qur\u2019an. Such an approach is unsatisfactory and, frankly, dishonest. Our task should be to uncover what the Qur\u2019an means by the term and then to apply it consistently. With this in mind, at <a>2:102</a> we have the first instance in the text of <i>fitnah</i>. The usage indicates an obvious relationship between temptation and trial on the one hand and denial of faith on the other. The broader context of the local narrative confirms this. Earlier in the verse we are told Sulaym\u0101n \u2018<i>[...]denied not; but the</i> <i>satans</i> <i>denied</i>\u2019. At the end of the verse we find that such persons have individually sold their souls with cognisance of the consequences of their actions.

However, that original site \u2014 no matter where it once was \u2014 is now closed to those who hold to the Qur\u2019an (see note to <a>9:28</a>), so if a place of pilgrimage is what is referenced here, such can only be of historical interest today.

The Traditionalist applies to this word the value of <i>a place of prayer</i> (and by <i>prayer</i> he means a ritual prayer found nowhere in the Qur\u2019an). I am not prepared to accept this level of specificity in a case with no Qur\u2019anic support. The facts we can support are these: <i>mu\u1e63all\u0101</i> is a noun of place based on the <i>\u1e63-l-w</i> root, a root which I connect with complete consistency with the concept of <i>duty</i> and generically with the obligation to serve God alone (as per <a>1:5</a>). The Traditionalist, on the other hand, applies his assumptions to that root selectively to gain the results he needs. In this case, he regards <i>mu\u1e63all\u0101</i> as a place of prayer at his box in Mecca. To me, the following two points seem reasonable precepts upon which to proceed: firstly, claims to certain, specialised knowledge of what <i>mu\u1e63all\u0101</i> indicates should, given the absence of concrete data, be treated with caution; secondly, it is irresponsible and intellectually dishonest to promote or accept theology based on the specific interpretation of ambiguous or unproven statements (cf. <a>3:7</a>). Of course, it may be that <i>mu\u1e63all\u0101</i> does in fact denote a place in the sanctuary which Ibr\u0101him instituted; if it does, I cannot prove it Qur\u2019anically \u2014 and nor can the Traditionalist. However, even if that still happens to be the case, I do know that the site of that sanctuary is not at Mecca; the evidence points to Petra, and that chapter of history is now closed, and was closed within the lifetime of the Messenger (see note to <a>9:28</a> and my book <i><a>The God Protocol</a></i>). That taken as given, the imperative at this verse indicates an object which it is both impossible to know with certainty and impossible to implement. Alternatively, if <i>the house</i> in the preceding clause simply means the house a man creates with his family as a monotheistic unit (which is undoubtedly what <a>2:125-141</a> treats of), then this <i>is</i> something we can adopt as a reasonable interpretation and apply to our lives. We can indeed aspire to the example of Ibr\u0101him in our marriages; to create families in which monotheism alone is practiced and promoted, even at the expense of our comfort in the broader society. It would be irresponsible to claim this as a central point of doctrine, and I do not do so. But since we know that the Traditionalist\u2019s cult is focused on an invalid location in any case (which makes null all and any claims he may make for this and related verses) it is not unreasonable to make enquiry of the Qur\u2019an on a logical and contextual basis even in those places where the Traditionalist\u2019s claims are both highly specific and objectively false."], ["2:125:7", "7.

If his inclination happens to correspond with reality and what is meant here is, in fact, a physical house, the place which the verse references is now lost to us (since Petra is now a ruin, and <a>9:28</a> closes this chapter of history conclusively). However, the statement can also be understood in a way which does have Qur\u2019anic support and which can serve as a lesson today if we take the house which Ibr\u0101him sought to purify to be that of his own family line (which is the point of the entire section at <a>2:125-141</a>). Ibr\u0101h\u012bm is, by common consent, the great Patriarch and example of monotheistic belief. The job of his descendants was to be pure and take monotheism to the world. We can all act on that imperative."], ["2:125:10", "10. Arabic: <i>\u1e6dawafa</i> \u2014 <i>to move about</i>. This is the first instance of the <i>\u1e6d-w-f</i> root in the text. This root requires some attention since words built upon aspects of it comprise part of the Traditionalist\u2019s \u2018<i>religious</i>\u2019 vocabulary. I mean by \u2018<i>religious</i>\u2019 vocabulary that subset of the total Qur\u2019anic lexicon to which the Traditionalist ascribes (usually inconsistently where such terms occur in multiple contexts) highly specialised definitions. He then trades on those highly specialised definitions to create in the minds of the ignorant, gullible, or inattentive the impression of correspondence between his religion (all details pursuant to which are taken from outside the Qur\u2019an), and the Qur\u2019anic text itself. Where a large number of contexts exist in the Qur\u2019anic text (such as with <i>\u1e63al\u0101t</i>, for example) his deceits are relatively easily exposed by inductive reasoning and methodical analysis. While words based on the <i>\u1e6d-w-f</i> root occur less frequently than those based on the root of <i>\u1e63al\u0101t</i>, we still have something to work with and, as we shall see, on this occasion the Traditionalist\u2019s pre-existing requirements force him to open the hole which traps him. So what is the Traditionalist\u2019s pre-existing requirement? It is that he needs words based on this root \u2014 occasionally, but not consistently \u2014 to mean <i>to perform circumambulation</i> (by which term he means the execution of a solemn, religious rite comprising walking around more than one holy site, the details of which are nowhere in the Qur\u2019an, but which he, the Traditionalist, says are important and claims to know). He must achieve this because he is committed to a broader event he calls <i>\u1e25ajj</i> as one of the five pillars which comprise his religion (mention of said pillars is, likewise, nowhere found in the Qur\u2019an), and his specialised value of <i>circumambulation</i> is claimed by him to be a component of that broader event. He must make this event and what he says are its components seem native to the Qur\u2019anic text since he claims the Qur\u2019an as the source document for his religion. Now that the Traditionalist\u2019s objective has been established, the reader can review what follows to form an opinion on how successful he has been in the case of the word under consideration. Words based on the <i>\u1e6d-w-f</i> root occur a total of 41 times in six forms. The forms which are of interest here are the form I verb (<a>37:45</a>, <a>43:71</a>, <a>52:24</a>, <a>55:44</a>, <a>56:17</a>, <a>68:19</a>, <a>76:15</a>, <a>76:19</a>), the associated form I active participle (<a>2:125</a>, <a>7:201</a>, <a>22:26</a>, <a>68:19</a>), and the form V verb (<a>2:158</a>, <a>22:29</a>). The mundane (non-religious) meaning of the form I verb is <i>to go about, walk about, travel about</i>; with <i>\u02bfal\u0101</i> it means <i>to circulate, make rounds</i>, <i>walk about</i> (<i>\u02bfal\u0101 among</i> e.g. people). With <i>bi</i> it acquires other nuances such as <i>to come to know; to familiarise oneself with</i>. The form V verb is given similarly mundane senses by Wehr (p. 671) of <i>to move about, rove, roam, wander, walk about</i>. The form V occurs twice (<a>2:158</a>, <a>22:29</a>), and both times in the context of what the Traditionalist calls <i>\u1e25ajj</i>. Usually, a single context makes it easier to claim highly specific \u2018<i>religious</i>\u2019 values \u2014 here: <i>to perform circumambulation</i> \u2014 without challenge, but this instance causes the Traditionalist a problem, albeit one which is not apparent to the casual observer. While the verb and preposition are the same in each case \u2014 <i>ta\u1e6dawwafa</i> (form V) plus <i>bi</i> \u2014 at <a>2:158</a> the object is dual, whereas at <a>22:29</a> the object is singular. Thus, no matter what one decides is the precise scenario in each case, given the Traditionalist\u2019s requirement of a highly specialised \u2018<i>religious</i>\u2019 sense in <i>both</i> cases, the net effect is a weakening of the power of his assertion, which is left potentially more vulnerable to ridicule than if he could point to a solidly uniform implementation for his value of religious <i>circumambulation</i>. However, his boat truly springs a leak at the point he extends his required meaning beyond the form V verb to include the form I participle at two places (<a>2:125</a>, <a>22:26</a>). Doctrinally, he has no choice but to ascribe there the same specialist meaning he ascribes to the form V verb if he is to seem to achieve the outcome we identified above. This requirement necessitates admission of all instances of the form I verb (<a>37:45</a>, <a>43:71</a>, <a>52:24</a>, <a>55:44</a>, <a>56:17</a>, <a>68:19</a>, <a>76:15</a>, <a>76:19</a>) and the two remaining instances of the form I participle (<a>7:201</a>, <a>68:19</a>) to the dataset. Most people take no notice of such details, naturally. But once noticed they are deadly to the impression the Traditionalist is committed to achieving since detailed analysis of this broader dataset places his specialised definition at <a>2:125</a> and <a>22:26</a> in open conflict with a broader sampling of Qur\u2019anic usage. In our own presentation of the text the mundane, non-specialised senses of all forms mentioned in this note fit naturally everywhere. And in those cases where the Traditionalist requires his specialised meaning, our mundane, non-specialised values comport fully with a scenario located at Petra where the visitor would be expected to <i>walk about</i> the numerous graves there to pay respects to his ancestors. While I think this is genuinely the meaning, I do not argue on that basis; partly because I do not need to (see note to <a>9:28</a>), partly because I do not want my findings to be ascribed the force of doctrine by others, and partly because I do not think the precise details matter here (at least, they matter here no more than those of any other historical event the Qur\u2019an mentions). I do, however, deny the Traditionalist the right to arrogate Qur\u2019anic histories to his cult-building project and then to insist upon my compliance with his extraneous narratives on the basis of values one can prove he applies to Qur\u2019anic terms on an entirely <i>ad hoc</i> basis. Also, the Traditionalist\u2019s assertions fail further when we consider Mecca as the place of pilgrimage on the basis of the Qur\u2019anic text (see Notepad XVI). I do not contest this point with the Traditionalist in my translation, and confine my dissent to the notes. The broader question is entirely moot since <i>al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m</i> was closed to believers within the time of the revelation (see note to <a>9:28</a>, and my book <i><a>The God Protocol</a></i>).

The Traditionalist claims this verse to indicate the raising of physical foundations of a building; namely, that of a building in Mecca which he calls the <i>ka\u02bfba</i>. I reject the possibility that he is factually correct out of hand given the impossibility of Mecca as the site of Ibr\u0101him\u2019s sanctuary (see Notepad XVI). However, some may decide that even though the Traditionalist is fixated upon the wrong location he is correct about the general sense of the verse so I will address the broader subject on the basis of etymology. This form of the root <i>r-f-\u02bf</i> (which the Traditionalist takes here to mean <i>to raise physically</i>) occurs 22 times in the Qur\u2019an (<a>2:63</a>, <a>2:93</a>, <a>2:127</a>, <a>2:253</a>, <a>4:154</a>, <a>4:158</a>, <a>6:83</a>, <a>6:165</a>, <a>7:176</a>, <a>12:76</a>, <a>12:100</a>, <a>13:2</a>, <a>19:57</a>, <a>24:36</a>, <a>35:10</a>, <a>43:32</a>, <a>49:2</a>, <a>55:7</a>, <a>58:11</a>, <a>79:28</a>, <a>88:18</a>, <a>94:4</a>); leaving aside the verse here at <a>2:127</a> and that at <a>24:36</a> (both of which relate to <i>bayt</i> or its plural) nowhere does this verb form relate to the creation of physical structures by men. That is not to say that I claim that the Traditionalist\u2019s general thesis \u2014 location notwithstanding \u2014 is objectively wrong. I don\u2019t know. And, frankly, nor does he. My position is that to base core theological doctrine on ambiguous statements is not acceptable. What is acceptable in circumstances such as these is to look at the preponderance of Qur\u2019anic evidence. And on that basis, I feel justified in asserting that the word here means <i>to elevate</i> and ascribing to <i>qaw\u0101\u02bfid</i> its non-physical sense of <i>precepts</i> given a Qur\u2019anic context which treats of Ibr\u0101him creating a family, a dynasty, a faith. I find it more reasonable given the preponderance of Qur\u2019anic evidence that a man who had left his tribe (which represented his worldly status, support and protection) because he would not follow its cult of created idols would then begin a new tribe based on purely monotheistic precepts free of idolatry than I do that he would build a new idol in the desert and begin bowing down to that. I cannot prove objectively that my thesis is correct; I simply argue that it makes more sense, given the Qur\u2019anic evidence, than popular and persistent alternate assertions. See note to <i>qaw\u0101\u02bfid</i> which follows. In this edition, I give the point to the Traditionalist in my translation, and confine my dissent to the notes. The broader question is entirely moot since <i>al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m</i> was closed to believers within the time of the revelation (see note to <a>9:28</a>, and my book <i><a>The God Protocol</a></i>).

While I do not claim historical objectivity for my own understanding, I do know that the Traditionalist has none for his, at least as far as his narrative relates to the city of Mecca. What I argue is that the preponderance of Qur\u2019anic evidence is against the Traditionalist\u2019s core claim at this point, no matter where located (see note to <a>9:28</a> and my book <i><a>The God Protocol</a></i>). This form of the <i>q-\u02bf-d</i> root occurs three times in the Qur\u2019an (<a>2:127</a>, <a>16:26</a> and <a>24:60</a>). At <a>24:60</a> the word relates to women specifically and we can disregard it for the purposes of our discussion here. While the remaining verse at <a>16:26</a> does relate to the foundations of a building \u2014 a fact which might seem to lend support to the Traditionalist\u2019s view \u2014 it is an unassailable fact that <a>16:26</a> can only be interpreted (and is, in fact, translated by the Traditionalist himself) as a <i>non</i>-<i>physical</i> house.

This clause occurs at <a>2:136</a>, <a>2:140</a>, <a>3:84</a> and <a>4:163</a>. While where this formula appears what follows it differs in each case, the leading statement and word order are stable: <i>to Ibr\u0101him, and Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl, and Is\u1e25\u0101q, and Ya\u02bfq\u016bb and al asb\u0101\u1e6d.</i> The Arabic word <i>asb\u0101\u1e6d</i> has two possible meanings: <i>grandsons</i> or <i>tribes</i>. Traditionalist translations generally employ <i>Tribes</i>, but Saheeh International has attempted to embrace both senses with <i>Descendants</i>. I render <i>Grandsons</i> in all comparable cases, and I do so for the following reasons: <a>2:136</a> and <a>3:84</a> speak of what was <i>sent down</i> <i>to</i> or <i>upon</i> the categories listed, and we learn at <a>4:163</a> that <i>al asb\u0101\u1e6d</i> received <i>wa\u1e25\u012b</i> (<i>instruction</i> or <i>inspiration</i> from God). We also know that among Ibr\u0101him\u2019s broader progeny there would be those who disregard God (<a>2:124</a>). Since we know that men who disregard God do not receive <i>wa\u1e25\u012b</i> \u2014 and we know that there have been countless ungodly men among the \u2018<i>Tribes\u2019</i> \u2014 it is not unreasonable to consider <i>grandsons</i> as the possible value. If we proceed on that basis, it is interesting to note that the formula always states <i>Ya\u02bfq\u016bb and al asb\u0101\u1e6d</i>. The principal figure, of course, is Ibr\u0101him. Ya\u02bfq\u016bb is himself a grandson of Ibr\u0101him via Is\u1e25\u0101q. However, (according to the Hebrew scriptures) Jacob had a twin brother Esau, and Abraham had other sons: Ishmael by Hagar and another six sons by Keturah: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. That all of Ibr\u0101him\u2019s grandsons \u2014 of whom Ya\u02bfq\u016bb was one, and which number included the sons of Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl and Ibr\u0101him\u2019s other sons \u2014 received instruction from God is something I can accept as correct. That all members of the tribes descended from Ya\u02bfq\u016bb received instruction from God (and are <i>de facto</i> godly men) is something I know is not true. This point, incidentally, fits with the broader thesis that Ibr\u0101him\u2019s primary mission was to create a new line of men who would found families and tribes submitted to God alone.

Clearly, that the same idea is repeated five times in such a small space indicates its importance. The question is: what does it mean? The Traditionalist, as we know, insists upon a requirement here to stand and bow in the direction of a building five times a day in a set of rituals he admits are found nowhere in the Qur\u2019an. However, neither prayer nor rituals of any kind are mentioned in the segment. Much closer to the actual import, I would assert, is the following: we know from clear statements in the Qur\u2019an that the Messenger and those with him were called upon to witness to the people of that time and place, to call them to God alone, and to warn them of the fate of the communities which had previously rejected the men God sent to warn them.

His claims are without foundation in the Qur\u2019an and can in no way be verified on the basis of its text \u2014 a fact which the Traditionalist knows and utilises to gain leverage for his broader claims. I cannot definitely prove that he is wrong in his claims for <i>al \u1e63af\u0101</i> and <i>al marwa</i>. It is impossible to prove a negative. Therefore, in the interests of intellectual integrity, I should allow that he might be right: perhaps <i>al \u1e63af\u0101</i> and <i>al marwa</i> do indeed indicate two small rock outcrops \u2014 bereft of Qur\u2019anic substantiation though the assertion is. I admit all manner of things I cannot disprove as abstract possibilities, and I have no reason not to extend the same allowance to the Traditionalist\u2019s claim here. I make no doctrinal claim for the thesis which follows \u2014 in the same way as I deny the Traditionalist the right to impose a theological construct upon me by his reading of this point. My case for the meaning of <i>al \u1e63af\u0101</i> and <i>al marwa</i> is this: we should remember that the Qur\u2019anic text we read today contains diacritic and other textual <i>accoutrements</i> which are interpretive in nature. This is not unusual for religious texts written in Semitic languages, which are deficient in certain markings in their simplest written forms. Hebrew texts have likewise passed through a process to clarify and standardise their readings. In the earliest Qur\u2019anic text such items as short vowels, <i>hamza</i>s and <i>sh</i><i>adda</i>s were not marked, or were marked inconsistently. This means that in the original unadorned text the two words in question read -<i>l\u1e63f\u0101</i> and -<i>lmrwh</i>. These can acceptably be pointed as -<i>l\u1e63af\u0101\u2019</i> and <i>-lmur\u016b\u2019ah,</i> which yields the values <i>felicity</i> and <i>manly generosity</i> respectively, which is what I incline towards, absent better information. These values make sense to me; the Traditionalist\u2019s assumptions, frankly, do not. I leave these two values untranslated. The broader question is entirely moot since <i>al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m</i> was closed to believers within the time of the revelation (see note to <a>9:28</a>, and my book <i><a>The God Protocol</a></i>)."], ["2:158:2", "2.

The Traditionalist claims, on the basis of no Qur\u2019anic evidence, that <i>\u1e25ajja al bayt</i> means, in effect, <i>perform a set of pilgrimage rites</i> (found nowhere in the Qur\u2019an) <i>at a religious centre</i> (for which there is no genuine Qur\u2019anic support) <i>in Mecca</i> \u2014 a city which, according to Dan Gibson (<i>Quranic Geography,</i> 2011), does not exist on any map until 900 CE. What the text actually says is <i>to \u2018\u1e25ajj\u2019 the house</i>. I accept that the noun <i>\u1e25ajj</i> denotes a pilgrimage in the Qur\u2019an because it is an established historical fact that annual pilgrimages were a feature of life in the region (i.e. to Petra), and because the noun <i>\u1e25ajj</i> is used in all cases in the Qur\u2019an in support of that sense. However, what the reader without access to Arabic may not know is that the root <i>\u1e25-j-j</i> denotes <i>debate</i> or <i>argument</i> and is commonly used in the Qur\u2019an in those senses (form III verb: <a>2:76</a>, <a>2:139</a>, <a>2:258</a>, <a>3:20</a>, <a>3:61</a>, <a>3:65</a>, <a>3:66</a>, <a>3:73</a>, <a>6:80</a>, <a>6:80</a>, <a>42:16</a>; form VI verb: <a>40:47</a>; noun: <a>2:150</a>, <a>4:165</a>, <a>6:83</a>, <a>6:149</a>, <a>42:15</a>, <a>42:16</a>, <a>45:25</a>). While I do not contend that <i>pilgrimage</i> (<i>\u1e25ajj)</i> as a noun and <i>argument</i> or <i>debate</i> are synonymous, it is beyond question that there is a strong etymological connection between them in Arabic generally, and in the Qur\u2019anic treatment of verbs and nouns based on the <i>\u1e25-j-j</i> root specifically. This fact suggests that the pilgrimage was \u2014 at least in part \u2014 an occasion for debate among those who attended. Rather than attempt to prove that <i>\u1e25ajja al bayt</i> means <i>to debate the house</i> (a point which I can argue, but cannot definitively prove) I have defaulted to the Traditionalist\u2019s own reading since one can safely concede the point to him to no effect given that <i>al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m</i> \u2014 no matter where located \u2014 has long been closed to those who follow the Qur\u2019an as a place of pilgrimage (see note to <a>9:28</a>)."], ["2:158:4", "4.

However, Lane lists the meaning of this verb as <i>to aim at</i> or <i>to purpose</i> (p. 2154). But since I cannot form a strong case for this meaning given the paucity of instances in the text, I have erred on the side of caution and followed the Traditionalist\u2019s predilection. Again, since the locale is held to be <i>al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m</i> it does not matter particularly what this instance of <i>\u2018amara</i> means since <i>al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m</i> is closed as a place of pilgrimage to those who follow the Qur\u2019an (see <a>9:28</a>) and the verse is now of a historical or analogous value only."], ["2:158:5", "5.

The <i>h-d-y</i> root occurs over 250 times in the Qur\u2019an specifically denoting <i>guidance</i>.

It is my best guess that what is meant here with regard to shaving the head is that a man was to wait until a given day or a particular station in the <i>\u1e25ajj</i> before shaving his head or cutting his hair in order to give him the time to hear out all the arguments before making a decision, a decision which was marked by the shaving of the head; however, these are speculations. Such speculations have no greater theological significance to us now than do speculations regarding the Qur\u2019anic histories of \u02bf\u0100d or Fir\u02bfawn. The <i>\u1e25ajj</i> mentioned in the Qur\u2019an passed into the pages of history around 1,400 years ago. The details and form of that tradition were known to the people for whom Petra represented a cultural, religious, and social centre. If the specific details of that institution were important for all people and all times they would have been included in the Qur\u2019an. They are not included in the Qur\u2019an, a point which the Traditionalist readily (even vociferously) acknowledges. What remains with regard to <i>\u1e25ajj</i> \u2014 as with all other Qur\u2019anic histories \u2014 are principal lessons only. Shaving occurs at one other place (<a>48:27</a>)."], ["2:196:6", "6.

This verb has three basic meanings: <i>to speak at length</i>, <i>to expound</i> (either with no preposition, or with a proposition such as <i>f\u012b</i>); <i>to be (fully) engaged in</i> or <i>to abandon oneself to</i> (which meanings take <i>f\u012b</i>); <i>to pour forth</i> (a transitive verb taking an indirect object with <i>\u02bfal\u0101</i>).

At <a>10:61</a> the particle is <i>f\u012b</i> and the surrounding context requires <i>to be (fully) engaged in</i> or <i>to abandon oneself to</i> as the sense.

This is only achieved by his typical means: shattering the context, inserting specious values for words, interpolation, and reliance upon the reader\u2019s textual ignorance and reluctance to challenge those he considers experts. Traditionalist translators Hilali &amp; Khan, for example, have here: <i>Guard strictly (five obligatory) As-Salawat (the prayers) especially the middle Salat (i.e. the best prayer - \u2018Asr). And stand before Allah with obedience [and do not speak to others during the Salat (prayers)]. And if you fear (an enemy), perform Salat (pray) on foot or riding. And when you are in safety, offer the Salat (prayer) in the manner He has taught you, which you knew not (before).</i> Even the most enthusiastic follower of the Traditionalist senses that such an imposition upon the text ruptures the narrative flow. But with the values we have established in this work, there is no rift in the text: we are to fear God and keep to a moderate course in our dealings with women; to apply the principles we are given the best we can; where we are lacking in knowledge and in an insecure situation, we are to do the best we can with what we know; when we are secure again, we are to verify and improve our knowledge.

The facts as found in the Qur\u2019an are these: the <i>w-s-\u1e6d</i> root occurs 5 times (<a>2:143</a>, <a>2:238</a>, <a>5:89</a>, <a>68:28</a>, <a>100:5</a>) and in all cases it denotes a middle-point between extremes; the meaning of <i>\u1e63al\u0101t</i> is established on a Qur\u2019anic basis as <i>duty</i> (see note to <a>2:3</a> and <a>Article SZC</a>); and the Qur\u2019anically established value for <i>\u1e63al\u0101t</i> fits perfectly with a Qur\u2019anically consistent value for the <i>w-s-\u1e6d</i> root in the context here."], ["2:238:3", "3.

This verse requires some attention since it features in arguments both for and against the doctrine of <i>taqiyah</i>, which word has come to be associated with a justification for dissimulation or outright falsehood. To begin: any mindset \u2014 \u2018religious\u2019 or otherwise \u2014 which wishes to find justification for lying will find it. To restrict ourselves to the realm of religion, one sees that in Christianity, Paul is much cited by those who wish to achieve such an end (e.g. Rom. , 1 Cor. -23, 2 Cor. -16), while observant Jews ask God to forgive them for the lies they will tell in the coming year in the Kol Nidre ceremony at Yom Kippur. To return to the Qur\u2019anic text, I would make the following points: 1. The word <i>taqiyah</i> (\u062a\u0642\u064a\u0629) is not found in the verse at <a>3:28</a> \u2014 or in any other verse of the Qur\u2019an in the standard text \u2014 although it is an accepted variant reading of the standard word <i>tuq\u0101t</i> (\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0629), and the two are regarded by Lane (p. 310) as synonyms, where he provides values covering: what one should fear, or what one should preserve oneself from. 2. The context at <a>3:28</a> has a military and political application (treating of the taking of allies). 3. The two verses immediately following <a>3:28</a> make plain that the intention of the heart is not hidden from God, and issue sobering warnings in that regard. Now that we have established these points, I would add the following: in military and political matters \u2014 especially when dealing with a superior force \u2014 the ability to mask one\u2019s intentions is vital; the believer can \u2014 in fact, must \u2014 do so, as must any individual or state which wishes to survive. However, the belief and intention in the case of the believer must not be compromised. This is an entirely different case to that which is both practiced by some called Muslims \u2014 or that of which others accuse them \u2014 namely, cynical and outright deception for gain. Both camps should discuss <a>3:28</a> only in the context of <a>3:29-30</a>. Traditionalist translators Hilali &amp; Khan render here: <i>except if you indeed fear a danger from them</i>, while Saheeh International has: <i>except when taking precaution against them in prudence</i>. Non-sectarian translator A. J. Arberry has: <i>unless you have a fear of them</i>, while N. J. Dawood has: <i>except in self-defence</i>. For myself, I take the import to be that we should have <i>taqw\u0101</i> (prudent fear) and not let our guard down when we are among <i>al k\u0101fir\u016bn</i>, understanding that they are an enemy to us. The value here of <i>the false claimers of guidance</i> for <i>al k\u0101fir\u016bn</i> makes the dissimulation from their side more obvious in translation than is the case in other presentations; to be fully frank and trusting with such people is not virtue, but recklessness."], ["3:30:1", "2:169:1"], ["3:30:2", "2.

By doing proper research, one sees that the values he prefers here (such as punish) are unsustainable on any pan-textual basis. (There exists a Qur\u2019anically-based punishment for those found guilty of the act under discussion here, but no such punishment is mentioned or called for at this particular juncture.) Part of the Traditionalist\u2019s abiding problem is that he is unable \u2014 at least on the basis of observable data \u2014 to understand the point of this legislation; he is, as one typically pictures him, straining for any opportunity to stage a lynching; to inflict unspeakable terror upon some poor, usually powerless individual (generally female), which spectacle helps deflect attention from his own towering incompetence and conspicuous lack of achievement. The purpose of the directive which has eluded him is, nevertheless, instantly clear to someone capable of rational thought, and it is this: it exists to set a society on a course which inclines towards virtue rather than away from it. We don\u2019t have to go far for an example since such a society existed in most Western countries until WWII. In a society of such a type, if a man and a woman are determined to have illicit sexual relations, nothing and no one can stop them given sufficient resources and opportunity. However, the society at large is not calibrated to facilitate such activity and does not condone such behaviour by providing social acceptance, hotel rooms, or collusion, etc. To look at this entire question of legislation objectively, one is struck by the fact that in order to be found guilty a couple would have to be so breathtakingly indiscreet that any subsequent punishment might be said to be justified on the basis of stupidity \u2014 were it not on the basis of immorality \u2014 given the lengths one would have go to in order to be caught. None of this interests the Traditionalist, of course. He does not follow the Qur\u2019anic directives; where murdering people is concerned he is nothing if not inventive \u2014 and he claims that the Qur\u2019an is abrogated by the \u2018sunnah\u2019 of the Prophet (the expression sunnah of the Prophet being shorthand for an endless list of things \u2014 an unspecified number of which are horrific, stupid, and extremely unfair \u2014 which he, the Traditionalist wants to do, and which are not in the Qur\u2019an).

Marriage in the Qur\u2019an is based in reality, not in fleeting, elusive, and changing emotions such as the nonsense promoted by media currently about \u2018romance\u2019, and pumped into the minds of both sexes via electronic delivery systems. Outside of such indoctrination, naturally, women wish to invest their youth and charms in men who are stronger, richer, and cleverer than are they; and, naturally, men wish to invest their resources and energies in women who are attractive, virtuous, obedient, and appreciative (cf. <a>4:34</a>). By founding the marriage contract in an agreement of a material nature, the couple (in concert with their families) can establish the relationship upon reality, and thus increase the chances of creating a successful union and secure environment for their children. Western countries baulk at the notion of setting a price for the man to cross the threshold to marriage, claiming that feelings are what matters. Thus, men are hoodwinked into entering into a formal, binding, legal contract in which women have no formal, binding, legal obligations, and upon which women are encouraged to renege at will; the society thinks nothing of supporting the woman in destroying the man financially, and depriving children of a father, once the \u2018feelings\u2019 of the woman change \u2014 which they frequently do given the typical modern woman\u2019s indoctrination inputs (entertainment, education, etc.). Viewed objectively, the current Western model is both barbaric and evil, and constitutes a systematic transfer of wealth from the hands of those with a higher potential to generate independence through wealth (men), into the hands of those with a lower ability to do so (women). Under this form of soft tyranny, men\u2019s wealth-creating power is taken from them by the state, and substantially frittered away by women on consumption items of no lasting value; thus, the society as a whole is made dysfunctional and dependent upon the state, and is more easily manipulated by the elites than would otherwise be the case."], ["4:24:6", "6.

Arabic: <i>\u1e0daraba</i>. Various imaginative interpretations of this instance of this word exist, particularly among more \u2018modernised\u2019 and \u2018modernising\u2019 Muslims. Their efforts notwithstanding, the verb <i>\u1e0daraba</i> still does mean <i>to beat</i> or <i>spank</i> or <i>strike</i> and in the context here there is little else that it could mean. Naturally, this single clause can be wrest from its context and made much of by people who feel that they benefit from so doing. I leave such people to enjoy whatever it is they think they gain from their activities; we all go to God. My position is this: the judicious spanking of a recalcitrant wife has been practiced by husbands who wished to achieve and maintain domestic harmony since time immemorial. It is recommended in the medieval Russian Orthodox handbook <i>\u0414\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439</i> (<i>Domostroi</i>), for example, and was practiced commonly in both ancient and later Western culture prior to the moral degradation which began in earnest following WWI and then with accelerated force following WWII. However, wife-spanking is still practiced today quite widely within certain Christian circles, and information attesting to its efficacy and value within both religious and non-religious households is not difficult to find. Contemporary liberals will be outraged by these facts, just as they are outraged by most facts. The high divorce rates, confusion of roles, demonstrable dysfunction, moral relativity, and celebration of blatant perversion which are standard fare among the victims of Cultural Marxism serve as an indication of the extent to which one should be guided by such people. Some women prefer a man who is forceful \u2014 they simply do. If a woman has grown up with a father who is strict, it will be difficult for her to respect a man who lets her manipulate or belittle him. In addition, many married couples attest to the fact that when the man takes full charge of his wife, it both saves the marriage and infuses it with vital energy and commitment. In the Qur\u2019anic context, one must not forget that this verse is directed to <i>those who heed warning</i> (see <a>4:29</a>). Both parties accept the Qur\u2019an and have access to it. The woman will know that if she pushes the man far enough he must \u2014 in keeping with the Qur\u2019an \u2014 respond eventually as outlined at <a>4:34</a>. She can, of course, initiate separation proceedings at any time. If she has not done so, and has pushed her husband beyond admonishment and separate sleeping arrangements, it is reasonable to assume that she is in tacit agreement with what is to follow. As intelligent, reasonable people of good will we can take it for granted that actual crimes against the person are to be responsibly prosecuted; if we are not intelligent, reasonable people of good will, our primary problems reside there and not in the quality of the guidance we are given.

In the present context, the preceding segment (at least from <a>4:36</a> to this point and, more fully, from the beginning of the chapter) makes a strong argument in favour of the core Qur\u2019anic doctrine; it summarises what one is signing up for. The verse at <a>4:43</a> then addresses those who have heeded what precedes. I understand the approach to the duty here as a point at which one may choose to make a serious undertaking to accept the doctrine of God and make a public statement to that effect. The actual contract between the Lord and his servant is found at <a>1:1-7</a>, aptly placed at the very beginning of the Qur\u2019an. It is my opinion that the prayer system of the Traditionalist retains in vestigial form the original acceptance statement of Qur\u2019anic principles by dint of its inclusion of <i>al f\u0101ti\u1e25ah</i> in every unit of its prayer system \u2014 despite the fact that few, if any, of those called Muslims today guess at its primary significance or purpose."], ["4:43:3", "3. The instance here of the form VIII of the verb <i>gh</i><i>asala</i> is the only one in the text. This fact makes it vulnerable to the Traditionalist\u2019s practice of ascribing highly specialised values to rare or unique terms \u2014 values which have no explicit Qur\u2019anic basis \u2014 and this opportunity has not been overlooked. The objective facts are these: the <i>gh</i><i>-s-l</i> root occurs a total of four times (<a>4:43</a>, <a>5:6</a>, <a>38:42</a>, <a>69:36</a>). Certainly, the <i>gh</i><i>-s-l</i> root means <i>to wash</i>; and in Arabic today the form VIII verb has a reflexive sense both of <i>to wash</i> and <i>to wash completely</i>. The Traditionalist, for his part, generally claims two types of \u2018religious\u2019 washing: <i>gh</i><i>usl</i> and <i>wu</i><i>dh</i><i>u</i>. By <i>gh</i><i>usl</i> he means a full-body wash (which is what he claims at this verse). By <i>wu</i><i>dh</i><i>u</i> he means the washing method (with some embellishments of his own) outlined at <a>5:6</a>. He has criteria for when either <i>gh</i><i>usl</i> or <i>wu</i><i>dh</i><i>u</i> should be done. These criteria do not correlate with the scenarios given at either <a>4:43</a> or <a>5:6</a> (for example, he claims that what he calls <i>gh</i><i>usl</i> is needed after contact with women but not that it is needed after defecation). The terms <i>gh</i><i>usl</i> and <i>wu</i><i>dh</i><i>u</i> are nowhere found in the Qur\u2019an. These are verifiable facts. My understanding based on the methodology here is this: what is meant by <i>unclean</i> is made clear in the sentence following the expression <i>then find not water</i> (namely: after illness, a journey, defecation or sexual intercourse). This is a concession \u2014 what to do when one does not find water. What, then, is to be done in the case where water <i>is</i> to be found? That instruction is given at <a>5:6</a>. The correlating verse at <a>5:6</a> does not use the form VIII of the verb <i>gh</i><i>asala</i> to describe the washing process; it bears no relation to the non-Qur\u2019anic word <i>gh</i><i>usl</i>. It uses another expression: <i>purify yourself</i> (based on the <i>\u1e6d-h-r</i> root). What <i>purify yourself</i> means in the context is, likewise, understood by inference from the concessive allowance at that verse, one which is identical to that at <a>4:43</a>. On this basis, my conclusions are these: the words for <i>washing</i> at <a>4:43</a> and <a>5:6</a> mean the same thing; the washing requirement for both cases (given access to water) is outlined at <a>5:6</a>; the terms <i>gh</i><i>usl</i> and <i>wu</i><i>dh</i><i>u</i> have no Qur\u2019anic basis (there being no case in which <i>gh</i><i>usl</i> as understood by the Traditionalist is a Qur\u2019anic requirement, and his requirement for what he calls <i>wu</i><i>dh</i><i>u</i> exceeds that mentioned in the Qur\u2019an).

And on the Day of Resurrection, he [\u2018Iesa (Jesus)] will be a witness against them.</em> Underpinning this presentation is the view that \u02bf\u012as\u0101 has never died. However, this assertion is impossible to sustain across the broader text since a distinct formula which treats of Ya\u1e25ya (whom no one claims never to have died) is employed also with regard to \u02bf\u012as\u0101 (compare <a>19:15</a> and <a>19:33</a>; see also <a>5:75</a>, <a>3:55</a>).

The agreement is then confirmed.</li>\n<li>There then follows a list of grievances against the doctors of the Law:<ul>\n<li><a>4:155</a> Violation of their agreement; their denial of proofs; their killing of prophets</li>\n<li><a>4:156</a> Their denial, and calumny against Maryam</li>\n<li><a>4:157</a> Their saying that they killed the messiah \u02bf\u012as\u0101, son of Maryam</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a>4:158</a> On the basis of <a>4:155</a>-<a>4:157</a> comes the conclusion: <em>God brought it</em> (i.e. the <em>agreement</em>) <em>before him</em> or <em>before himself</em>. The verb <em>rafa\u02bfa</em> + \u2018<em>il\u0101</em> means <em>to bring before</em>, <em>bring forward</em> as before a judge or king (Lane, p. 1128). That meaning is confirmed by the words immediately following <em>And God is exalted in might and wise</em> (the word <em>wise</em> in Arabic implies sage judgment).</li>\n<li><a>4:159</a> <em>There is no doctor of the Law</em> (i.e. true doctor of the Law) <em>save will believe therein</em> (i.e. in the <em>agreement</em> mentioned at <a>4:153</a>) <em>before his death</em>; <em>And on the Day of Resurrection it</em> (the <em>agreement</em>) <em>will be witness against them</em>.</li>\n<li>Verses <a>4:160-161</a> continue with grievances against those who hold to Judaism in general on a different basis</li>\n</ul>"], ["4:159:1", "1.

The on-the-nose rendering here is: <i>But those firm in knowledge among them and the believers believe in what is sent down[...].</i> I have used a different word order in the English and some may take issue with that, so I will address what I anticipate to be their concerns. I have strong pan-textual grounds and contextual support for the rendering I have used. To begin with, a second subject often comes in Qur\u2019anic Arabic at the end of the clause, almost as an afterthought (see the following examples <a>7:155</a>, <a>7:156</a>, <a>18:26</a>, <a>22:37</a>, <a>24:5</a>, <a>24:10</a>, <a>24:20</a>, <a>24:50</a>, <a>26:73</a>, <a>27:18</a>, <a>27:49</a>, <a>28:82</a>, <a>28:83</a>, <a>34:10</a>, <a>34:36</a>, <a>40:71</a>, <a>43:71</a>, <a>48:29</a>, <a>53:62</a>, <a>57:10</a>, <a>58:12</a>, <a>59:8</a>, <a>93:3</a>). The entire preceding section treats of the Jews, their failings and misdeeds, and both this verse and the verse following indicate and connect with a summary of (mainly Hebrew) patriarchs and key figures. With these facts in view, the phrase in the opening of <a>4:162</a> \u2014 <i>among them</i> \u2014 seems implicitly present within each of three categories which follow: <i>[...]the upholders of the duty (among them), and the renderers of purity (among them), and the believers in God and the Last Day (among them).</i> (It is difficult for the Traditionalist to access this point because he is mesmerised by the words <i>\u1e63al\u0101t</i> and <i>zak\u0101t</i> to which he is trained from birth to attach alien, non-Qur\u2019anic values.) My second point is that the concept of <i>mu\u2019min</i> (<i>believer</i>) does not pertain exclusively to those who embrace the Qur\u2019an, or those who are \u2014 or who call themselves \u2014 Muslims, despite the fact that the word has been used historically as though that were the case. There is no direct correlation with <i>belief</i> and any temporal or political grouping. (Rightly understood, a <i>mu\u2019min</i> is one whose condition of soul is imbued with a sampling of Grace by which he inclines towards and appreciates the things of God.) The Qur\u2019anic text objectively regards certain individuals among Christians, Jews and others (as well as those who predate both Jews and Christians) as <i>mu\u2019min</i>s (see <a>5:43</a> for example). My position is that the entire passage at <a>4:153-162</a> forms one argument and has one focus: the doctors of the Law among the Jews, most of whom are reproved and some of whom are exonerated. There then follows a broader appeal comprising a correlation between what previous messengers received and the present revelation (<a>4:162-170</a>) before the section ends with a final appeal to the doctors of the Law at <a>4:171</a>."], ["4:162:5", "5.

The Traditionalist claims for <i>\u1e25urum</i> a specialised, religious connotation (namely, the state of increased sanctity a man is said to be in when on pilgrimage). Naturally, the Traditionalist controls all definitions and details pursuant to this condition, and his formulations are nowhere found in the Qur\u2019an. The point at which the Traditionalist makes the correlation with pilgrimage is found not in the current exhortation, but in the one following at <a>5:2</a> and the connection claimed by the Traditionalist is weak since <a>5:2</a> simply prohibits preventing those who wish to visit the inviolable place of worship from so doing (as one prohibition among several).

This leaves little room to assess its meaning from usage. The Traditionalist asserts a highly specialised value here (and presents himself as the authority, naturally, on the right interpretation and application of his specialised value). For him <i>qal\u0101\u2019ida</i> signifies <i>garlands</i> or <i>necklaces</i> (to be put around the necks of animals selected for slaughter). I reject the value of <i>sacrificial animal</i> for <i>hadya</i> as spurious on the basis of provable Arabic values (see note to <a>2:196</a>). With regard to <i>qal\u0101\u2019ida</i> I prefer to look to the Arabic language, context, and logic for answers than rely on the Traditionalist and his claims. The facts are these: <i>qal\u0101\u2019ida</i> is a plural noun formed from the <i>q-l-d</i> root. The meanings of the <i>q-l-d</i> root focus on the <i>investment of office</i>, <i>awarding authority</i>, or <i>placing in power</i>. It is true that it can mean <i>to adorn with a necklace</i>, but this meaning is clearly secondary and subsequent to the primary meaning, and grew out of the use of the necklace \u2014 or chain \u2014 as a badge of authority or office. Since the context, both here and at <a>5:97</a>, treats of hunting being <i>forbidden</i> the question arises: by whom? On the basis of these considerations I contend that <i>qal\u0101\u2019ida</i> denotes <i>necklaces</i> in the sense of <i>chains of office</i> and not, as the Traditionalist claims, in the sense of <i>necklaces for sacrificial animals</i> \u2014 a value which one assumes to have been imposed through a syncretic process originating in Hinduism. (Objective, methodical analysis notes the Hinduistic nature of many of the Traditionalist\u2019s rites and practices but finds justification for such practices nowhere in the Qur\u2019an.) In this edition, I give the point to the Traditionalist in my translation, and confine my dissent to the notes. The broader question is entirely moot since <i>al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m</i> was closed to believers within the time of the revelation (see note to <a>9:28</a>, and my book <i><a>The God Protocol</a></i>).

Thus, for the Traditionalist, this instance of this word provides the reverse of what he claims for <i>\u1e25urum</i> (see <a>5:1</a> and note thereto) namely, that condition which exists <i>outside</i> the specialised ritual condition he claims as the meaning of <i>\u1e25urum</i>. If he is right, he cannot prove it on the basis of the Qur\u2019an; I suspect it is a later fiction, but I cannot definitively prove my suspicion.

Or <i>within the span of</i>. The Traditionalist typically renders the sense here as <i>after a period [of suspension] of the messengers.</i> I follow A. J.

I suggest the rendering above for the following reasons: the verb <i>bayyana</i> (<i>announce, make clear</i>) nowhere operates with the preposition <i>\u02bfal\u0101</i>, and the preposition seems to be hanging (the preposition <i>\u02bfal\u0101</i> can have many meanings, to choose one at random given no association with a verb is simply to guess \u2014 and if the Traditionalist can guess then so can we all). Secondly, nowhere does the word <i>after</i> appear in the sentence \u2014 despite what translations typically presume, imply or insert. Nor does it say <i>between</i> anywhere in the sentence (some translators have it that there is an interval <i>between</i> the appearance of the messengers; but to read <i>min</i> as <i>between</i> in this single instance is a highly original treatment); the primary ways to render <i>min al rusul</i> are: <i>of the messengers</i> or <i>among the messengers</i> or <i>from the messengers.</i> Thirdly, the operative noun <i>fatrah</i> does \u2014 as the Traditionalist translators say \u2014 mean a <i>period of time</i> or <i>interval</i> or <i>span of time</i>. However, the text simply does not say <i>between</i> messengers, it says <i>of</i> or <i>among</i> messengers. Lastly, I return to the aforementioned hanging <i>\u02bfal\u0101</i>; by constructing the entire verse minus this one item I was able to choose of the many values available to that preposition with some degree of confidence in presenting my alternative reading above (see the beginning of <a>2:102</a> for an instance of comparable usage). In summary, I believe what is in view here is that Mu\u1e25ammad\u2019s ministry fell within that total span of time during which messengers came to men, not that it came after a lull in the appearance of messengers."], ["5:20:1", "1. The Traditionalist, who has typically accepted uncritically the dominant Egypt-Palestine thesis and the Christian extension thereof, has historically experienced a twinge of awkwardness at this juncture, something which may be sampled by acquaintance with Muhammad Asad\u2019s attempt to ease those concerns: <i>According to most of the commentators (e.g., Tabari, Zamakhshari, Razi), the \u201ckingship\u201d of the Israelites is a metaphorical allusion to their freedom and independence after their Egyptian bondage, the term \u201cking\u201d being equivalent here to \u201ca free man who is master of his own affairs\u201d (Manor VI, 323 f.) and can, therefore, adopt any way of life he chooses.</i> The Traditionalist\u2019s problem \u2014 given prior acceptance of the dominant thesis listed above \u2014 is that, under that thesis, the children of Israel of the Hebrew scriptures had no kings under Moses; and the statement here at <a>5:20</a> brushes against the fur of the prevailing narratives found in the Hebrew scriptures. There exist alternative theses, however. Under the Arabia Felix thesis, for example, Fir\u02bfawn is simply a tribal king; moreover, the statements at <a>7:128-129</a> and then at <a>7:137</a> appear to serve the Arabia Felix thesis against the Egypt-Palestine thesis since the Qur\u2019an suggests \u2014 or appears to suggest \u2014 that the children of Israel inherited the land held by Fir\u02bfawn \u2014 a position which the Egypt-Palestine thesis cannot support. Given such a reading, as inheritors to Fir\u02bfawn, the children of Israel would indeed have been made kings in the lifetime of M\u016bs\u0101.

Arabic: <i>inj\u012bl</i> \u2014 generally translated as Gospel based on the assertion that <i>inj\u012bl</i> is a corruption or abbreviation of <i>\u03b5\u1f50\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd</i>, euang\u00e9lion or <i>good news</i>. I have followed this convention, but we need purchase on what is meant by the term. In the earliest account of the four versions Christians accept as canonical, Mark, Jesus preaches <i>\u2018the gospel of the kingdom of God\u2019</i> (Mark <a>1:14</a>). There is no further elucidation on the term gospel than that found in Mark. The word gospel occurs a total of eight times in Mark. In the next canonical account to be written, Matthew, Jesus is again preaching <i>\u2018the gospel of the kingdom\u2019</i> (Matt. <a>4:23</a>, <a>9:35</a>). At <a>24:14</a> he is most emphatic: \u2018And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.\u2019 The word gospel occurs five times in Matthew. In the next canonical account to be written, Luke, Jesus adds no definition to his use of the word gospel; the term is used as though its sense is understood. The word gospel occurs four times in Luke. In the last canonical account to be written, John, the word gospel occurs nowhere. Thus, in those books claimed as canonical histories of Jesus by the Christians nowhere do we find any elucidation on the word gospel beyond the fact that it pertains to the kingdom of God. We note that the kingdom of God is something Jesus told his followers to pray for, since it forms a key part of the Lord\u2019s Prayer, and that the preaching of the kingdom of God is either a prerequisite for \u2014 or a signal of \u2014 the end of all things (Matt. <a>24:14</a>). Of course, \u2018the kingdom of God\u2019 is not substantially what Christians mean by gospel, their core conception of gospel being singularly resistant to genuine identification with the words of Jesus. They have adopted Paul\u2019s gospel, and expend huge efforts and millions of dollars annually to preach that, and are surprised that the End does not come. (They are not alone in falling for such sleight of hand; Muslims are equally proof against considering their Book on its own terms, having long ago abandoned that endeavour in favour of later compositions and dogmas built thereupon.) What Christians in fact mean by gospel is, of course, a moving target. What, then, does the Qur\u2019an mean by inj\u012bl? We find a good example here at <a>5:46</a> which yields the facts that the inj\u012bl contains \u2018guidance and light\u2019 (which together) confirm what \u02bf\u012as\u0101 had access to of the Torah, and that it is \u2018guidance and admonition for those of prudent fear\u2019. A broader review of all contexts reveals the following: the inj\u012bl is mentioned at <a>3:3</a>, <a>3:48</a>, <a>3:65</a>, <a>5:66</a>, <a>5:68</a>, <a>5:110</a> in one breath with the Torah \u2014 from which we deduce a high correlation between the two; at <a>7:157</a> we find something written (both in the Torah and the inj\u012bl) \u2014 from which we infer the inj\u012bl to be something written (either extant, or lost in whole or in part); at <a>9:111</a> God promises the believers the Garden in return for their lives and their wealth (as a promise binding upon God in the Torah and the inj\u012bl and the Qur\u2019an) \u2014 thus, like both the Torah and the Qur\u2019an, the inj\u012bl contains at its heart a commitment on the part of the believer to put the Hereafter before the present life; and at <a>48:29</a> the inj\u012bl is mentioned in relation to that parable which has survived to us as the parable of the mustard seed (which itself references the Kingdom of Heaven as an inner realm within a man which begins as something insignificant but grows to dominance within the soul and character until such point \u2014 in the Qur\u2019anic presentation \u2014 that the atheists are enraged) \u2014 thus, we identify for the inj\u012bl the characteristic of a potent but initially imperceptible force which, given right cultivation, may grow within the soul of a man to such a point that it supersedes previous concerns and comes to thwart attempts by atheists to quell or crush it; at <a>57:27</a> there is mention of the inj\u012bl as something given to \u02bf\u012as\u0101 and of compassion and mercy placed in the hearts of those who followed it (or, possibly, him). We need now a fuller understanding of what the Gospel means to Christians. Wikipedia tells us: In Christianity, the gospel (Greek: \u03b5\u1f50\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd euang\u00e9lion; Old English: gospel), or the Good News, is the news of the coming of the Kingdom of God (Mark <a>1:14-15</a>), and of Jesus\u2019 death on the cross and resurrection to restore people\u2019s relationship with God. It may also include the descent of the Holy Spirit upon believers and the second coming of Jesus. This is a fair summary of what the majority of those who claim the Gospel today mean by the term, although most of it derives, as we have said, from Paul, not Jesus. We will now consider the components we have garnered from the Qur\u2019anic statements here and what we understand of the Christian position vis-\u00e0-vis the Gospel or inj\u012bl in sum to place before us all facets of what is meant by the term: 1. Some part of the Torah teachings (and confirmation thereof) or, at least, something related to the Torah. 2. A guidance and admonition for those of prudent fear. 3. A doctrine predicated upon the coming Kingdom of God; one which imbues the believer with increasing strength. 4. Something which is \u2014 or at least was \u2014 written down. 5. Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection as an act which reconciles man to God and forgives sin. 6. The descent of the Holy Spirit upon believers (understood to be an event auguring non-natural, supernatural or pseudo-supernatural abilities). 7. The Second Coming of Jesus (as the event marking the end of the Age). The Qur\u2019anic position is, then, that points 1, 2, 3 and 4 either represent \u2014 or, at least, comport with \u2014 what inj\u012bl means. Points 5, 6 and 7 either find no support in the Qur\u2019an or are directly repugnant to it. On the basis of the above, the working definition suggested here for what the Qur\u2019an means by inj\u012bl (Gospel) is: a Torah-related guidance given to \u02bf\u012as\u0101 orientated towards a reward in the Kingdom of Heaven found in written form and which increases the aspirant in piety. Under the Christian extension of the dominant Egypt-Palestine thesis the Qur\u2019an\u2019s presentation of \u02bf\u012as\u0101 is regarded exclusively in terms of a one-to-one correlation between \u02bf\u012as\u0101 and the Jesus of the 1st century CE. Both the \u02bfAs\u012br-\u1e24ej\u0101z and Arabia Felix theses begin from points which reject that assumption. I refer the interested reader to Notepad XVI and Notepad XVIII.

The Orientalist for his part accepts this assessment, and the popular media bandies the same about in simplified form. The only problem with this cosy consensus is that the Qur\u2019an itself claims no such thing for <i>sh</i><i>ir\u02bfa</i>, <i>sh</i><i>ar\u012b\u02bfa</i> or any other word.

Additionally, stripped of its sectarian values, <a>5:86-92</a> can be seen as appealing to the broader reach of believers, not only to a particular sect called today Muslims. Not all translators see the text in the same light, however. With justification (given the liquid nature of tense in Classical Arabic), non-sectarian Arabist A. J. Arberry renders the whole verse in the present: <i>There is no fault in those who believe and do deeds of righteousness what they may eat, if they are godfearing, and believe, and do deeds of righteousness, and then are godfearing and believe, and then are godfearing and do good; God loves the good-doers</i>; <i></i>staunch Traditionalists Hilali &amp; Khan take a hybrid approach: <i>Those who believe and do righteous good deeds, there is no sin on them for what they ate (in the past), if they fear Allah (by keeping away from His forbidden things), and believe and do righteous good deeds, and again fear Allah and believe, and once again fear Allah and do good deeds with Ihsan (perfection). And Allah loves the good-doers.</i> Lastly, Traditionalist Saheeh International renders, like Hilali &amp; Khan, to imply a cut-off for previous sins given a believing present: <i>There is not upon those who believe and do righteousness [any] blame concerning what they have eaten [in the past] if they [now] fear All\u0101h and believe and do righteous deeds, and then fear All\u0101h and believe, and then fear All\u0101h and do good; and All\u0101h loves the doers of good.</i> One could make arguments for all the readings listed; it is a matter of interpretation rather than of grammar."], ["5:93:6", "2:194:6"], ["5:93:7", "2:189:7"], ["5:94:1", "2:9:1"], ["5:95:1", "2:9:1"], ["5:95:2", "2.

At <a>5:6</a> the word <i>ka\u02bfba</i> (in the dual) has the uncontested sense of <i>ankles</i> or <i>leg-joints</i>. The Traditionalist himself translates thus there. The word <i>ka\u02bfba</i> \u2014 admittedly ending with <i>t\u0101\u02be marb\u016b\u1e6da</i> (\u0629) occurs also at <a>5:95</a> and <a>5:97</a>. Here, however, the Traditionalist claims \u2014 on the basis of no Qur\u2019anic evidence \u2014 that the value at these two locations is <i>a box-shaped structure in Mecca to which one should prostrate himself.</i> It is a quantum leap from the proven, known value of the word at <a>5:6</a> to what the Traditionalist claims for <a>5:95</a> and <a>5:97</a>, and given that he expects one to practice on the basis of his claim what he himself would call idolatry did he himself not practice it, I think we should stop and consider the facts. Firstly, the verses at <a>5:95</a> and <a>5:97</a> are his primary points of purchase within the Qur\u2019an for his beloved structure at Mecca. Secondly, structures of this type were found all over Arabia, and have pagan origins (thus, the notion that his box is unique is erroneous). Thirdly, the Qur\u2019an contains multiple explicit warnings against worshipping anything but God, yet here the Traditionalist wishes one to ignore those and bow down to his box (cf. <a>3:7</a> and notes thereto). Naturally, I cannot prove on the basis of the Qur\u2019an that <i>ka\u02bfba</i> never meant what the Traditionalist claims for it, just as the Traditionalist cannot prove on the same basis that it did. What I can point to is the only explicit, clear value of a comparable word \u2014 one with which the Traditionalist agrees \u2014 and say that I accept that meaning. And on that basis, I incline towards an approximately equal value here also \u2014 not least because it makes sense. The scenario as I read it is this: an animal is killed when hunting is forbidden, the only remaining evidence of which is a corpse or skeleton. The condition of an animal may be ascertained by inspection of the leg-joints (lameness in animals being the primary threat to their economic viability \u2014 especially among nomadic or semi-nomadic peoples). In order to form their judgment, two just men should inspect the joints of the animal to ensure that what is given in payment is no worse than what was illegally killed. (This point was developed from an original insight by Aidid Safar to whom I am indebted here.) In this edition, I give the point to the Traditionalist in my translation, and confine my dissent to the notes. Were I to capitalise this word and remove italics, it would imply an endorsement for a sense which I refuse to allow into my work; accordingly, I simply transliterate the Arabic and leave the word italicised. The broader question is entirely moot since <i>al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m</i> was closed to believers within the time of the revelation (see note to <a>9:28</a>, and my book <i><a>The God Protocol</a></i>).

This segment is so loaded with values which the Traditionalist bends to his requirements that it is tiresome to list them all. However, in the interests of thoroughness, we should note that this word also is hammered here into service on the basis of various agendas. The Traditionalist translators at Saheeh International render here: <i>standing for the people</i> (by which they mean standing as a sign confirming the Traditionalist\u2019s religion); Hilali &amp; Khan have here: <i>an asylum of security and Hajj and \u2018Umrah (pilgrimage) for mankind</i> \u2014 for which rendering I can find little correlation in the text; to be charitable, we will assume it is a mistake on their part; A.

The second meaning Lane gives is <i>to reckon something much, abundant or many</i>. Before considering which of these options is more likely, we will look at how this collocation is typically rendered. We will remember, of course, that historically Muslims have conflated a number of Qur\u2019anic conventions, considering them all to mean non-human entities, generally called Jinn. This subject is unpicked at <a>Article SJC</a>. The salient point for us here is that <i>al</i> <i>jinn</i> means <i>dominant human beings</i> (rendered here by the Latin term <i>domini</i>), and that it is this dominant minority which rules the affairs of men. But it is natural that translations should be directed by understanding and, historically, the understanding of <i>al jinn</i> has been that summarised above. Accordingly, N. J. Dawood renders here: <i>He will say: \u2018Jinn, you have seduced mankind in great numbers.\u2019</i> A. J. Arberry has: <i>\u2018Company of jinn, you have made much of mankind.</i>\u2019 Saheeh International has: <i>\u201cO company of jinn, you have [misled] many of mankind.\u201d</i> Muhammad Asad, ever expansive, has: <i>\u201cO you who have lived in close communion with [evil] invisible beings! A great many [other] human beings have you ensnared!\u201d</i> And Hilali &amp; Khan have: <i>\u201cO you assembly of jinns! Many did you mislead of men\u201d</i>. The common denominator here is the notion of <i>much</i> \u2014 which is the core sense of the verb root; beyond that, the translators have embellished on the basis of their understanding. The plain senses provided by Lane do not suit them because they do not fit with the notion of non-human entities. But if <i>al jinn</i> means simply that coterie of dominant men (the <i>domini</i>) which directs the masses (the <i>servi</i>), then the psychological resistance to a plain reading falls away. There remains only the question of which of the two senses Lane provides is more likely, and given the context \u2014 an address to the rulers concerning the ruled \u2014 the more likely case is the one I have used."], ["6:128:3", "3.

As for the word jamal occurring in this sentence, there is hardly any doubt that its translation, in this context, as \u201ccamel\u201d is erroneous. As pointed out by Zamakhshari (and confirmed by other classical commentators, including Razi), Ibn</i> \u2019<i>Abbas used to read the word in the spelling jummal, which signifies \u201ca thick rope\u201d or \u201ca twisted cable\u201d; and the same reading is attributed to</i> \u2019<i>Ali ibn Abi Talib (Taj al-</i>\u2019<i>Arus). It is to be noted that there are also several other dialectical spellings of this word, namely, jumal, juml, jumul and, finally, jamal (as in the generally-accepted version of the Qur</i>\u2019<i>an) - all of them signifying \u201ca thick, twisted rope\u201d (Jawhari), and all of them used in this sense by some of the Prophet</i>\u2019<i>s Companions or their immediate successors (tabi</i>\u2019<i>un). Ibn</i> \u2019<i>Abbas is also quoted by Zamakhshari as having said that God could not have coined so inappropriate a metaphor as \u201ca camel passing through a needle</i>\u2019<i>s eye\u201d - meaning that there is no relationship whatever between a camel and a needle</i>\u2019<i>s eye whereas, on the other hand, there is a definite relationship between the latter and a rope (which, after all, is but an extremely thick thread). On all accounts, therefore, the rendering of jamal as \u201ca twisted rope\u201d is, in this context, infinitely preferable to that of \u201ca camel\u201d. The fact that the latter rendering occurs in a somewhat similar phrase in the Greek version of the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew xix, 24, Mark x, 25 and Luke xviii, 25) does not affect this contention. One should remember that the Gospels were originally composed in Aramaic, the language of Palestine at the time of Jesus, and that those Aramaic texts are now lost. It is more than probable that, owing to the customary absence of vowel signs in Aramaic writing, the Greek translator misunderstood the consonant spelling g-m-l (corresponding to the Arabic j-m-l), and took it to mean \u201ca camel\u201d: a mistake repeated since, with regard to the above Qur</i>\u2019<i>anic verse, by many Muslims and all, non-Muslim orientalists as well.</i>"], ["7:41:1", "1.

The Traditionalist view is that the expression <i>al nab\u012b al ummiyy</i> (<i>the unschooled</i> or <i>heathen prophet</i>) is an epithet used exclusively for the Prophet Mu\u1e25ammad. I do not agree with that view, and these are my reasons: from <a>7:103</a> to this point (over 50 verses), the narrative is focused solely on the history of M\u016bs\u0101. M\u016bs\u0101 was not schooled in the Writ; rather, he received the Writ by means of revelation. Under the dominant Egypt-Palestine thesis, he was brought up as an Egyptian; under the Arabia Felix and \u02bfAs\u012br-\u1e24ej\u0101z theses, he was brought up in the house of a tribal chief named Fir\u02bfawn. In any event, by the standard we use here to judge <i>ummiyy</i> (<i>i.e. one outside or ignorant of the Writ</i>) M\u016bs\u0101 was \u2014 at least until he received the Writ \u2014 fully <i>ummiyy</i>. The expression <i>al nab\u012b al ummiyy</i> (<i>the unschooled</i> or <i>heathen prophet</i>) occurs just twice in the Qur\u2019an \u2014 here and in the next verse. Due to his disproportionate emphasis on Mu\u1e25ammad, the Traditionalist, in my opinion, has missed the point being made here. The point is not that Mu\u1e25ammad was unlearned and therefore the Qur\u2019an is all the more a miracle (which is the version the Traditionalist promulgates); it is that M\u016bs\u0101 was unschooled in the Writ <i>and so was Mu\u1e25ammad</i>. The Traditionalist view places the narrative pivot after the long account of M\u016bs\u0101 here at <a>7:157</a>. But it is simply not there. It comes in the next verse (<i>Say thou[...]</i>). Logically speaking, at <a>7:157</a> the person being described is the same individual the previous 53 verses were dedicated to; namely: M\u016bs\u0101. It is M\u016bs\u0101 who is <i>[...]the unschooled prophet \u2014 whom they find written with them in the Torah and the Gospel[...]</i> (to the end of the verse). It is only at <a>7:158</a> that the narrative shifts to Mu\u1e25ammad. The point of this device, in my opinion, is to establish a correlation between the first unschooled prophet M\u016bs\u0101 (who brought his people out of bondage and gave them a Writ) and Mu\u1e25ammad who had a comparable mission for the whole of humanity.

The term <i>al mu\u2019min\u016bn</i> is generally translated (which convention I follow) as <i>the believers</i>. The problem with the idea of <i>belief</i> in English is that it can be associated either with gullibility or with opinion based upon nothing concrete, or it invites the assumption that one who has it has something which defies any analysis. Happily, we have the Qur\u2019an\u2019s definition of the term by which a believer \u2014 more specifically <i>\u2018a believer in truth\u2019</i> \u2014 can identify himself as such to himself on the basis of set criteria as straightforwardly as can a mechanic or a nurse.

They uphold the duty (to serve him alone, seek help from him alone, and obey his laws) 5. They spend out of what God gives them. The second half of this definition is found at <a>8:74</a> and it comprises: 6. Those who believe 7. Those who emigrate 8. Those who strive in the cause of God 9. Those who give shelter 10.

However, if a man has none of these qualities (or is deficient in one or more of them) and has no desire to acquire them, he may be many things but <i>a believer in truth</i> is not one of them.

It can mean <i>to divert (e.g. a person turns away another person from something).</i> But it can also mean <i>to forsake (e.g. a person himself turns away from something).</i> For more on this ambiguity in the Arabic see Lane (p. 1668) where we find that the preposition <i>\u02bfan</i> offers nothing by way of concrete guidance. The Traditionalist typically renders in both senses but without any discernible system. My own understanding is: where there exists a human object I regard the verb in its first application (e.g. <i>he diverts his friend from the road</i>); where there is no human object I see the verb its second application (e.g. <i>he forsakes the road</i>).

To my mind, the second of these two interpretations is preferable, and particularly so in view of the fact that the Qur\u2019an often explains in these terms the attitude of \u201cthose who deny the truth\u201d (e.g., in <a>6:25</a>, <a>7:179</a>, <a>9:87</a>, etc.).</i>"], ["8:66:1", "3:17:1"], ["8:67:1", "1.

This is a crucial point in the Traditionalist\u2019s presentation, and by reviewing the translation of the present clause by the staunchly Traditionalist Hilali &amp; Khan, we can understand quite how crucial it is; it reads as follows: <i>(and) if you (Muslims of the whole world collectively) do not do so (i.e. become allies, as one united block with one Khalifah - chief Muslim ruler for the whole Muslim world to make victorious Allah\u2019s Religion of Islamic Monotheism).</i> By his own lights, only six of these words are in the text. And to have any sort of scriptural justification, his reading requires that the following be found in the Qur\u2019an: 1. \u2018<i>Allah\u2019s Religion of Islamic Monotheism</i>\u2019 as intoned by the Traditionalist; 2. an instruction to have a single king (\u2018<i>Khalifah - chief Muslim ruler for the whole Muslim world</i>\u2019); 3. an instruction to make \u2018<i>Allah\u2019s Religion of Islamic Monotheism</i>\u2019 binding upon others.

The Traditionalist assigns the instance here at <a>9:25</a> the value of a proper noun (that of a name he claims for a specific valley near Mecca which he asserts as the name of the precise location of the battle described here). The attentive reader will have noted the Traditionalist\u2019s habit of claiming implausible levels of specificity \u2014 ones which defy any sort of verification on the basis of the Qur\u2019anic data \u2014 which tend towards a single end: to make him and his preferred literature the arbiter in the reading of God\u2019s revelation. Mecca as the locus for any portion of the Qur\u2019anic narrative is here rejected (see Notepad XVI and note to <a>9:28</a> as well as my book <i><a>The God Protocol</a></i>), so claims for a location of any kind in that vicinity may be safely ignored. The <i>\u1e25-n-n</i> root covers senses of <i>longing, yearning, nostalgia, craving, desire</i>. A plausible sense is \u2014 given a marking of <i>\u1e25anayn</i> rather than <i>\u1e25unayn</i> \u2014 is, perhaps, <i>(two) desires</i>; meanwhile, Lane (p. 657) notes that the Arabs called a particular month <i>\u1e25unayn</i> (cf. <i>rama\u1e0d\u0101n</i> at <a>2:185</a>). Since I cannot prove either case definitively, I have elected to leave the word untranslated, and to capitalise it (thereby treating it as a proper noun, and conceding the point to the Traditionalist in my translation). While I do not accept any of what Muhammad Asad writes here, I include it for the broader understanding of the interested student: <i>The battle of Hunayn, a valley situated on one of the roads leading from Mecca to Ta\u2019if, took place in the year 8 H., shortly after the conquest of Mecca by the Muslims. The latters\u2019 opponents were the pagan tribes of Hawazin (in whose territory the valley lay) and their allies, the Band Thaqif. The Muslim army - reinforced by many newly-converted Meccans - comprised about twelve thousand men, whereas the Hawazin and Thaqif had only one-third of that number at their disposal. Relying on their great numerical superiority, the Muslims were over-confident and, apparently, careless. In the narrow defiles beyond the oasis of Hunayn they fell into an ambush prepared by the tribesmen and began to retreat in disorder after heavy losses had been inflicted on them by the bedouin archers. It was only the example of the Prophet and his early adherents (the Meccan muhajirun and the ansar from Medina) that saved the day and turned the initial rout of the Muslims into a decisive victory. It is to this battle that verses 25 and 26 refer, pointing out that true succour can come only from God, and that great numbers, ties of kinship and worldly wealth are of no avail if they are \u201cdearer to you than God and His Apostle and the struggle in His cause\u201d (see preceding verse).</i> As usual, the broader question is entirely moot since <i>al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m</i> was closed to believers within the time of the revelation (see note to <a>9:28</a>, and my book <i><a>The God Protocol</a></i>)."], ["9:26:1", "3:28:1"], ["9:26:2", "3:149:2"], ["9:26:3", "3. It is my understanding that this refers to the undesirable turn of events outlined at <a>9:25</a>, a view which is supported at <a>9:27</a> also. It bears repeating that the term <i>al k\u0101fir\u016bn</i> does not apply exclusively to an external force of \u2018unbelievers\u2019; it is how the Qur\u2019an identifies those who claim virtue but fail to meet its requirements."], ["9:26:4", "2:89:4"], ["9:28:1", "2:9:1"], ["9:28:2", "3:95:2"], ["9:28:3", "3. Typically read <i>So let them not approach</i>, the textual justification for reading <i>l\u0101 taqrab\u016b</i> rather than <i>l\u0101 yaqrab\u016b</i> follows. The Traditionalist\u2019s reading of this verse (provided here by Saheeh International, which is typical) is as: <i>O you who have believed, indeed the polytheists are unclean, so</i> <i><u>let them not approach</u></i> <i>al-Masjid al-\u1e24ar\u0101m after this, their [final] year. And if you fear privation, All\u0101h will enrich you from His bounty if He wills. Indeed, All\u0101h is Knowing and Wise.</i> The underlined portion of the verse above indicates that part of the text which is rendered by the form I verb <i>qaraba \u2014 to approach, draw near</i>. There are 11 instances of the form I of this verb in the Qur\u2019an (<a>2:35</a>, <a>2:187</a>, <a>2:222</a>, <a>4:43</a>, <a>6:151</a>, <a>6:152</a>, <a>7:19</a>, <a>9:28</a>, <a>12:60</a>, <a>17:32</a>, <a>17:34</a>). All instances are preceded by the negative particle <i>l\u0101</i>. In 10 of the 11 instances we find <i>qaraba + l\u0101 +</i> the jussive mood, and one case (<a>12:60</a>) <i>l\u0101</i> is followed by the imperfective. In all cases it provides a direct warning against approaching something or, as in the case of <a>12:60</a>, provides a statement of limitation of access to something. The verse at <a>9:28</a> is immediately conspicuous because only here has the Traditionalist pointed the text not in the second person (<i>approach you not</i>), but in the third person (<i>let them not approach</i>) \u2014 the difference here being merely that of placing two dots below the stem rather than above it \u2014 such dots not being intrinsic to the text in any case. However, this pointing of the verb here at <a>9:28</a> \u2014 one which is conspicuously anomalous across all other instances of this verb \u2014 requires that we accept a form of imperative in this single instance found nowhere else in the text. The force which is imputed to this word by the Traditionalist\u2019s reading is \u2018<i>let them not approach</i>\u2019. This type of exhortation certainly exists in the Qur\u2019an (e.g. \u2018<i>let not such-and-such think that[...]</i>\u2019). But this convention, where it occurs \u2014 and <i>especially where it appeals to a third-person plural subject</i> \u2014 is a rhetorical device, and operates as an <i>exhortation</i>, or as <i>strong advice</i>. (Consider, for example, <a>51:59</a> \u2014 \u2018<i>so let them not seek to hasten Me!</i>\u2019) It nowhere operates as a literal imperative (there is no expectation that the hearer will literally prevent such-and-such from thinking anything whatever \u2014 although it is recommended that they comply). But at <a>9:28</a>, the Traditionalist\u2019s pointing of this one word requires that we accept a form of imperative found nowhere else in the Qur\u2019an: it requires that the reader take this rhetorical construction directed to a third-person plural subject as a binding, literal imperative upon himself. In summary, in order for the Traditionalist\u2019s pointing of this word to be valid, it requires \u2014 in this single instance \u2014 firstly, that we allow that, while all remaining instances of this verb are negative constructions which treat of second-person subjects, here it does so with a third-person subject; and secondly, that \u2014 in a case unique to the entire Qur\u2019an \u2014 a negative jussive exhortation treating of a third-person plural subject has a literal imperative force binding upon the hearer. I do not accept this as a rational or reasonable position. The case I accept, is that this word is as I have translated it \u2014 \u2018<i>approach not</i>\u2019 \u2014 which reading does not require aberrant handling of the verb under discussion (given an otherwise uniform set across the Qur\u2019an), and does not require that we impose upon the Qur\u2019an a uniquely anomalous instance of a rhetorical device as a literal, binding imperative. During the final editing phase of this work, I was sent an objection to this thesis which, despite the objection\u2019s obvious weaknesses, I will address here. The critic (who referenced his own fluency in Arabic in support of his argument) asserted that the verb cannot refer to the believers since God addresses the believers directly in the beginning of the verse (the idea being that some sort of tautology results when an address to a particular party is followed directly by an imperative to the same party). However, the Qur\u2019an is full of such constructions (<a>9:23</a> and <a>9:119</a> being merely two which are close to hand). Additionally, the critic\u2019s point is not only incorrect in its assertion, it is also at least partly wrong in its premise, since the verb at <a>9:28</a> as read by him implies an imperative to those addressed in any case for who is to prevent \u2018<i>those who ascribe a partnership</i>\u2019 from approaching \u2018<i>the inviolable place of worship</i>\u2019 if not those addressed in the verse?"], ["9:28:4", "2:217:4"], ["9:28:5", "5.

Consequently, we may assume that the reference, in this context, to \u201cGod\u2019s Apostle\u201d is not confined to the person of the Prophet Muhammad but implies, metonymically, the Law of Islam as revealed through him - and, thus, to every government that holds authority by virtue of that Law and rules in accordance with it.</i>"], ["9:59:3", "3.

In view, however, of the many statements in the Qur\u2019an that on the Day of Judgment the sinners will not only not conceal but will, rather, stress their remorse, some of the commentators (e.g., Baghawi, on the authority of Abu \u2018Ubaydah) are of the opinion that in this particular verse the verb asarra denotes the opposite of its primary meaning and, accordingly, interpret the phrase as \u201cthey will manifest their remorse\u201d. But the linguistic validity of this rather forced interpretation has been emphatically contested by many philologists, and particularly by Abu Mansur al-Azhari (cf. Lane IV, 1337); and since there is no convincing reason to disregard the original significance of the verb asarra with its implication of \u201cconcealment\u201d, the above Qur\u2019anic phrase must be understood (as Zamakhshari understands it), in the metonymical sense of an involuntary \u201cconcealment\u201d, that is, the sinners\u2019 inability to express the full depth of their remorse.</i>"], ["10:54:3", "3:21:3"], ["10:55:1", "2:13:1"], ["10:55:2", "6:31:2"], ["10:55:3", "3.

His awareness of a dissonance with his required value at <a>2:142-145</a> is revealed here if we look at his attempts to paper over the cracks of his problem in the present context. Saheeh International has here: <i>and make your houses [facing the] qiblah</i>. The words in square brackets are imagined to exist by the translators; they are not in the text. Hilali &amp; Khan sidestep this problem by other means: <i>and make your dwellings as places for your worship.</i> This is a stretch, but to the inattentive reader may seem close enough. But is \u2018<i>place(s) for your worship</i>\u2019 what they understand by <i>qiblah</i> at <a>2:142-145</a>? Of course not. In both cases, we discern subterfuge. And this sleight of hand persists also in the minds of those who read in Arabic because the priests of the religion of Islam correctly understand that they can rely upon those who follow them to exercise little or no intellectual rigour. However, if we look to a non-specialised, \u2018unmullahised\u2019 meaning of this word (such as <i>destination</i> or <i>course</i>), we find that it fits both scenarios perfectly. The only remaining problem is one for the Traditionalist, in that this plain meaning does not meet his cultic requirements. Additionally, while some claim that the local narrative at <a>10:87</a> refers to the night of the Passover, close analysis proves that the Passover is in no way corroborated by the Qur\u2019an.

The stress here is on the intrinsic impossibility of reconciling belief in the One God, whose omniscience and omnipotence, embraces all that exists, with an attribution of divine or semi-divine qualities and functions to anyone or anything else. The subtly-veiled suggestion of the Thamud and its rejection by Salih has a bearing on all religious attitudes based on a desire to \u201cbring God closer to man\u201d through the interposition of alleged \u201cmediators\u201d between Him and man. In primitive religions, this interposition led to the deification of various forces of nature and, subsequently, to the invention of imaginary deities which were thought to act against the background of an undefined, dimly-perceived Supreme Power (for instance, the Moira of the ancient Greeks). In higher religious concepts, this need for mediation assumes the form of personified manifestations of God through subordinate deities (as is the case, in Hinduism, with the personifications of the Absolute Brahma of the Upanishads and the Vedanta in the forms of Vishnu or Shiva), or in His supposed incarnation in human form (as represented in the Christian idea of Jesus as \u201cGod\u2019s son\u201d and the Second Person of the Trinity). And, lastly, God is supposedly \u201cbrought closer to man\u201d by the interposition of a hierarchy of saints, living or dead, whose intercession is sought even by people who consider themselves to be \u201cmonotheists\u201d - and this includes many misguided Muslims who do not realize that their belief in saints as \u201cmediators\u201d between men and God conflicts with the very essence of Islam. The ever-recurring Qur\u2019anic stress on the oneness and uniqueness of God, and the categorical denial of the idea that anyone or anything - whether it be a concrete being or an abstract force - could have the least share in God\u2019s qualities or the least influence on the manner in which He governs the universe aims at freeing man from the self-imposed servitude to an imaginary hierarchy of \u201cmediating powers\u201d, and at making him realize that \u201cwherever you turn, there is God\u2019s countenance\u201d (<a>2:115</a>), and that God is \u201c[always] near, responding [to the call of whoever calls unto Him]\u201d (<a>2:186</a>; also, in a condensed form. in verse 61 of this surah).</i>"], ["11:64:1", "2:211:1"], ["11:64:2", "7:165:2"], ["11:65:1", "7:77:1"], ["11:65:2", "2.

My understanding of this imperative (one directed here to the recipient of the Qur\u2019an alone) derives from the context, and suffers from none of the Traditionalist\u2019s problems with al \u1e63al\u0101t since I treat it, as does the Qur\u2019an, as a generic noun (i.e. a noun the specific meaning of which depends upon the context; cf. al \u1e63abr). Most of the chapter (<a>11:25-95</a>) rehearses the example of warners sent to their respective peoples prior to the destruction of God being made binding upon those peoples. There follows at <a>11:96-108</a> a summary of the eternal condition of those on either side of the decision for God. At <a>11:109-111</a> the narrative turns to the Prophet, directing his attention to the people of his time and place. At <a>11:112</a> he is told to keep to the right path (a path one may reasonably deduce only as a function of what has preceded, and as a directive to act upon that basis). At <a>11:113</a> he and those with him are admonished not to place confidence in those who do wrong, with a warning that the Fire will touch them (cf. <a>11:96-108</a>) as a consequence of disobedience. Now, at <a>11:114</a>, comes the imperative in question, directed to the Messenger himself. At this point, the Traditionalist has him praying a number of prayers each day. But what about the entire preceding context? The verse at <a>11:114</a> also includes the promise: good deeds take away evil deeds! If the claim is that such good deeds comprise performing a prayer regimen the Traditionalist himself cannot find in the Qur\u2019an, that does gross violence to the context at the very least. More likely, given the context, the \u1e63al\u0101t mentioned comprises a call to repentance and reform. By way of confirmation, <a>11:115</a> calls the Messenger to patience, whereas <a>11:116</a> laments that more people were not found forbidding corruption among former peoples. The only interpretation which makes sense is that at <a>11:114</a>, the Messenger is to repeat the example of former messengers by doing what they did: forbidding corruption and warning the people. Any other reading removes two-thirds of <a>11:114</a> from the context entirely, and produces that stilted dissonance which so characterises any reading which assumes the Traditionalist\u2019s conclusions. My broader (and much more detailed) analysis concludes that this process of warning was to take the form of three discrete concatenated readings taken from between s\u016brah 50 and s\u016brah 114, in a nightly service. Thus, the two ends of the day And at an approach of the night means: the time preceding dawn, and dusk, and the time following dusk.

This extremely plausible explanation contrasts sharply with the Biblical account of this incident (Genesis xliv), according to which the false accusation was part of an inexplicable \u201cstratagem\u201d devised by Joseph. If we discard - as we must - this part of the Biblical version, it is far more logical to assume that Joseph, who had been granted by the King full authority over all that belonged to the latter (see verse 56 above), had placed the royal cup as a present in the bag of his favourite brother; and that he did this secretly, without informing his servants, because he did not want anyone, least of all his ten half-brothers, to know his predilection for Benjamin.</i>"], ["12:74:1", "1.

Muhammad Asad broadly concurs in his translation with the conclusion here, rendering: <i>and [in God] all people have a guide.</i> I reproduce his note below in full: <i>According to the classical commentators, this sentence lends itself to several interpretations: (1) \u201cThou art only a warner; and every nation has had a guide like thee (i.e., a prophet)\u201d- which would be in consonance with the Qur\u2019anic doctrine of the continuity of prophetic guidance; or (2) \u201cThou art only a warner - but [at the same time] also a guide unto all people\u201d - which would stress the universality of the Qur\u2019anic message as contrasted with the time-bound and ethnically limited missions of the earlier prophets; or (3) \u201cThou art only a warner bound to do no more than deliver the message entrusted to thee, while it is God alone who can truly guide men\u2019s hearts towards faith\u201d. Since the last of the above three interpretations is the most plausible and has, moreover, the support of \u2018Abd Allah ibn \u2018Abbas, Sa\u2019id ibn Jubayr, Mujahid and Ad-Dahhak, I have adopted it in my rendering.

I include Muhammad Asad\u2019s note here for interest: <i>The rendering of the above passage hinges on the meaning given to the term mu\u2019aqqibat-a double plural of mu\u2019aqqib, which signifies \u201csomething that comes immediately after another thing\u201d or \u201csucceeds another thing without interruption\u201d. Most of the classical commentators understand by mu\u2019aqqibat \u201chosts of angels\u201d, i.e., the recording angels who attend on every human being, succeeding one another without interruption. Consequently, they interpret the phrase min bayni yadayhi wa-min khalfihi as meaning \u201cranged before him and behind him\u201d, i.e., surrounding man from all sides; and they explain the words \u201cfrom God\u2019s command\u201d as being here synonymous with \u201cby God\u2019s command\u201d, and take them to refer to the angels or to their function of guardianship. However, this interpretation has by no means the support of all the commentators. Some of the earliest ones assume that the term mu\u2019aqqibat refers to all manner of worldly forces or concepts on which man so often relies in the mistaken belief that they might help him to achieve his aims independently of God\u2019s will: and this is the meaning given to this elliptic passage by the famous commentator Abu Muslim al-Isfahani, as quoted by Razi. Explaining verse 10 and the first part of verse 11, he says: \u201cAll alike are, in God\u2019s knowledge, deeds done secretly or openly, as well as he who hides in the darkness of night and he who walks [boldly] in the light of day... : for he that resorts to the [cover of] night can never elude God\u2019s will (amr), just as he [cannot] that walks in the light of day, surrounded by hosts of helpers (mu\u2019aqqibat)- that is, guards and aids - meant to protect him: [for] those guards of his cannot save him from [the will of] God.\u201d It is on this convincing interpretation that I have based my rendering. The worldly \u201cguards and aids\u201d on which a sinner relies may be tangible (like wealth, progeny, etc.) or intangible (like personal power, high social standing, or the belief in one\u2019s \u201cluck\u201d): and this explains the phrase \u201cboth such as can be perceived by him and such as are hidden from him\u201d.</i>"], ["13:11:5", "7:37:5"], ["13:12:1", "1.

The term salsal, occurring in three verses of this surah as well as in <a>55:14</a>, adds a further dimension to this concept. According to most of the philological authorities, it denotes \u201cdried clay that emits a sound\u201d (i.e., when it is struck); and since it is used in the Qur</i>\u2019<i>an exclusively with reference to the creation of man, it seems to contain an allusion to the power of articulate speech which distinguishes man from all other animal species, as well as to the brittleness of his existence (cf. the expression \u201clike pottery\u201d in <a>55:14</a>). As the construction of the sentence shows, this salsal is stated to have evolved (Razi) out of hama</i>\u2019 <i>- which, according to some authorities, is the plural of ham</i>\u2019<i>ah, signifying \u201cdark, fetid mud\u201d or \u201cdark slime\u201d - while the participial adjective masnun which qualifies this noun denotes, as Razi points out, both \u201caltered\u201d (i.e., in its composition) and \u201cbrought into shape\u201d: hence my rendering of this expression as \u201ctransmuted\u201d, which to some extent combines both of the above meanings. To my mind, we have here a description of the primeval biological environment out of which the \u201csounding clay\u201d - the matrix, as it were - of man</i>\u2019<i>s physical body has evolved in accordance with God</i>\u2019<i>s plan of creation.</i>"], ["15:27:1", "1.

However, the context does not treat of that topic \u2014 or of anything remotely connected with it. Additionally, the verb form itself contains the nuance of <i>dividing</i> or <i>distributing among themselves</i> (see for example Wehr, p. 893), a nuance the Traditionalist disregards. While the operative verb here (Arabic: <i>anzala \u2014 to send down</i>) together with <i>\u02bfal\u0101</i> is used both for good things (such as rain) as well as for punishments (scourges or annihilation), the preceding words <i>I am the clear warner</i> (see note to <a>15:89</a>) can leave us in no doubt as to which of the two options is in view. The Traditionalist also disregards the dominant theme of the chapter as a whole: the extent of provision allowed to former peoples (and, by extension to the present hearers) prior to their destruction (verses <a>15:3-4</a> set the tone for what follows). On the basis of these facts, surely the payload here is a warning to those made materially comfortable by <i>distributing</i> the good things of this life <i>among themselves</i>.

Moreover, the Qur\u2019an states in many places that whereas this particular ancestor of the Hebrews - and, by the way, of most of the Arab tribes as well - was a personification of all that is good and upright, so that \u201cGod exalted him with His love\u201d (<a>4:125</a>), his Jewish descendants always tended to rebel against God and, thus, \u201cpersistently wronged themselves\u201d.</i>"], ["16:120:2", "4:125:2"], ["16:120:3", "2:105:3"], ["16:123:1", "4:163:1"], ["16:123:2", "4:125:2"], ["16:123:3", "2:105:3"], ["16:124:1", "1.

However, the object could also mean <i>him</i>. Muhammad Asad takes it in that sense, for example, and relates it to Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. While I am not persuaded by his argument, I include it for interest: <i>The implication is that the majority of the Jews had deviated from the true creed of Abraham (which is the meaning of the phrase, \u201cthose who came to hold divergent views about him\u201d) inasmuch as most of them became convinced that they were \u201cGod\u2019s chosen people\u201d simply because of their physical descent from that great Prophet: an assumption which obviously runs counter to every truly religious principle. As the Qur\u2019an repeatedly points out, this spiritual arrogance was punished by God\u2019s imposition on the children of Israel - and on them alone - of all manner of severe restrictions and rituals, of which the obligation to refrain from all work and even travel on the Sabbath was one.

The preceding verses treat of doctrinal skirmishes with those of existing faiths in the context of God\u2019s overarching knowledge.

The Traditionalist links this verse to a claim originating in the <i>\u1e25ad\u012b</i><i>th</i> <i></i>literature wherein Mu\u1e25ammad is said to have entered the heavens on the back of a mythological steed and negotiated with God on the number of daily prayers. This is a crucial connection, since without it the Traditionalist\u2019s claim for the divine nature of what he calls <i>al \u1e63al\u0101t</i> (his highly specified understanding of which he has made a pillar of his religion) can point to no definitive purchase within the Qur\u2019an. The details of the Traditionalist\u2019s narrative (in which Mu\u1e25ammad supposedly meets M\u016bs\u0101 who encourages him to beat God down to a manageable number of prayers) is anathema to the Qur\u2019an, and has more in common with parts of the Talmud. In any event, the claim that <i>al masjid al aq\u1e63\u0101</i> indicates the mosque of that name in Jerusalem is clearly erroneous since no such building existed until after the Muslims took Jerusalem. I can offer three options at this juncture. Firstly, one could argue that the present context suggests M\u016bs\u0101 rather than Mu\u1e25ammad as the subject since M\u016bs\u0101 is the first person named in the segment; an assessment which comparison with <a>27:8</a> might support. Within the Petra thesis \u2014 or, at least, the Petra pilgrimage thesis \u2014 one may reasonably suppose <a>17:1</a> to indicate a journey from <i>al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m</i> (in Petra) to Jabal al Lawz in Midian in the northern part of what today is Saudi Arabia near the border with Jordan about 120 miles away, if one takes <i>al masjid al aq\u1e63\u0101</i> to indicate that place M\u016bs\u0101 received the Commandments and accepts Jabal al Lawz as its location. Secondly, if one considers the instances where <i>We blessed</i> (Arabic: <i>b\u0101rakn\u0101</i>) occurs across the text, one could form the view that the reference is to Ibr\u0101h\u012bm (see <a>7:137</a>, <a>17:1</a>, <a>21:71</a>, <a>21:81</a>, <a>34:18</a>, <a>37:113</a>). Thirdly, if we take Petra as the location of <i>al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m</i> and assume the land of modern Israel as that of the prophets, then the allusion is simply to a night journey undertaken by Mu\u1e25ammad from Nabataean Arabia towards Jerusalem, a route along the King\u2019s Highway which inevitably would have presented him with a vista of the cities of L\u016b\u1e6d destroyed by God by the Dead Sea (cf. <a>15:73-77</a>, <a>25:40</a>, <a>37:133-138</a>)."], ["17:1:5", "2:61:5"], ["17:2:1", "2:79:1"], ["17:2:2", "3:79:2"], ["17:3:1", "1.

Hence, man\u2019s spiritual fate depends on himself and is inseparably linked with the whole tenor of his personality; and since it is God who has made man responsible for his behaviour on earth, He speaks of Himself as having \u201ctied every human being\u2019s destiny to his neck\u201d.</i> This opinion is fully supported by the verses which follow."], ["17:13:2", "4:153:2"], ["17:14:1", "2:89:1"], ["17:16:1", "1.

Since the earlier prophets invariably appealed to their own community and their own time alone, their teachings were, of necessity, circumscribed by the social and intellectual conditions of that particular community and time; and since the people to whom they addressed themselves had not yet reached the stage of independent thinking, those prophets stood in need of symbolic portents or miracles[...] in order to make the people concerned realize the inner truth of their mission. The message of the Qur</i>\u2019<i>an, on the other hand, was revealed at a time when mankind (and, in particular, that part of it which inhabited the regions marked by the earlier, Judaeo-Christian religious development) had reached a degree of maturity which henceforth enabled it to grasp an ideology as such without the aid of those persuasive portents and miraculous demonstrations which in the past, as the above verse points out, only too often gave rise to new, grave misconceptions.</i>"], ["17:59:3", "3.

The question, then, is only <i>what</i> should be supplied and <i>where</i>. To take the second item first, we should look to the next verse since it begins with the same formula (Arabic: <i>wa i</i><i><u>dh</u></i> <i>quln\u0101</i>) we find here at <a>17:60</a>. Since the line beginning that verse introduces a complete thought, a requirement of completion may be inferred for <a>17:60</a>, and I place the ellipsis accordingly.

Additionally, what immediately follows the formula (Arabic: <i>wa i</i><i><u>dh</u></i> <i>quln\u0101</i>) at <a>17:61</a> treats of compliance with \u2014 or submission to \u2014 the word of God, and that compliance is both anticipated and mirrored at <a>17:60</a> by means of the text we have supplied.

The context fits better an obligation to warn by means of the Qur\u2019an, which point we expand upon in the notes following.

The primary meaning of the verb with which this noun is associated is <i>to rub</i> or <i>to press</i> or <i>to squeeze</i> (often: <i>until things merge</i>). The expression <i>dul\u016bk al shams</i> signifies that time at which the sun seems to merge with the horizon. The expression <i>dul\u016bk al shams</i> is noted by Wehr (p. 335) as <i>sunset</i>. The Traditionalist has two problems at this point. Firstly, he is unable to conceive of <i>al \u1e63al\u0101t</i> as the generic, abstract noun it clearly is (cf. <i>al \u1e63abr</i>). And, secondly, having particularised the general, he has also locked himself into the dogma of five daily rituals on the basis of his non-Qur\u2019anic literature. He is in the unenviable position of Cinderella\u2019s ugly sisters: he must make the glass slipper fit come what may, but reality is against him. Thus, he has it that <i>dul\u016bk al shams</i> means <i>the time</i> <i>after the sun passes the meridian</i>. By extending his notion of sunset in this way, he can convince himself that what is meant here is provision for a number of \u2018prayers\u2019 nowhere mentioned here in the text. By way of example, the Traditionalist translators at Saheeh International render here <i>Establish prayer at the decline of the sun [from its meridian] until the darkness of the night</i>, to which they add the note: <i>i.e., the period which includes the thuhr, a\u1e63r, maghrib, and \u2018ish\u0101\u2019 prayers.</i> The Traditionalist just needs to get one more of his five-prayer set through the goalposts. But this is sleight of hand, and any reasonably intelligent child without prior indoctrination would recognise it as such. What no one seems to ask is: if four \u2018prayers\u2019 can be found in this space, why not six, or ten \u2014 or a hundred? The fact is that the Traditionalist is locked in to values taken from elsewhere, and is committed to cramming the glass slipper onto a fat, hairy foot no matter if it shatters in the process \u2014 which, of course, in the light of any sensible analysis, it does (one has only to consider <a>11:114</a> for the Traditionalist\u2019s manipulations with <i>dul\u016bk al shams</i> to be exposed, despite the incursions the Traditionalist employs against the plain sense of the text there also).

I have no objection to prayer, including to that of the Traditionalist, minor points notwithstanding. I have no objection to prayers being held at the time the Traditionalist holds them, or at any other time. I <i>do</i> object to his practice of claiming monopoly rights over a book which itself claims to be from God and complete, and then of importing his values for key terms in that book from elsewhere and proceeding to attack anyone who doesn\u2019t agree with him. And I also object to his allied practice of manipulating the plain sense of the text to make it seem to fit with his externally derived requirements.

Razi, however, is of the opinion that the \u201cwitness\u201d to which the Qur\u2019an refers here is the spark of God-given illumination in man\u2019s own soul - the heightening of his inner perception at the time when the darkness and stillness of night begins to give way to the life-giving light of day, so that prayer becomes a means of attaining to deeper insight into the realm of spiritual truths and, thus, of achieving communion with all that is holy</i>. This is all very uplifting, but it is plucked from the ether; it has no purchase in the Qur\u2019an. The passive participle <i>ma</i><i><u>sh</u></i><i>h\u016br</i> (<i>witnessed</i>) occurs in three places: <a>11:103</a>, <a>85:3</a>, and here at <a>17:78</a>. At <a>11:103</a>, the context anticipates the Day of Judgment; it is a day to which mankind (<i>al n\u0101s</i>) is being gathered, and that day is \u201c<i>witnessed\u201d</i>. The active party here is God; the object, human beings. At <a>85:3</a>, the preceding context (provided at <a>85:1-2</a>) is an oath which includes the Day of Judgment (cf. <a>11:103</a>), and the key phrase the \u201c<i>witnessed</i>\u201d precedes actions by men in which they (men) are themselves \u201c<i>witnesses</i>\u201d (see <a>85:4-9</a>). The segment concludes with the statement that God is \u201c<i>witness</i>\u201d over all things. Thus, the \u201c<i>witness</i>\u201d of <a>85:3</a> must refer in the first instance to God, and the \u201c<i>witnessed</i>\u201d of <a>85:3</a> to that which men have done and seen. And on the basis of what we have learned at <a>11:103</a> and <a>85:3</a>, \u201c<i>the witnessed</i>\u201d of <a>17:78</a> must refer to that which is done and seen <i>by men</i>. My analysis of \u2018the mysterious letters\u2019 (Arabic: <i>al \u1e25ur\u016bf al muqa\u1e6d\u1e6da\u02bf\u0101t</i>) contains within it evidence of a series of three portions of the Qur\u2019an beginning at s\u016brah 50, and which the Qur\u2019an itself calls <i>al suj\u016bd</i>. These sections comprise the text to be recited as a witness to those the Messenger was sent to warn. (This process is likely retained by parts of the Traditionalist\u2019s prayer regimen in vestigial form, though he has lost its original purpose entirely.) These readings were to be open for attendance by men. The \u2018<i>recitation of dawn</i>\u2019 <i></i>was to be <i></i>\u2018<i>witnessed</i>\u2019 by men at the conclusion of a process in which <i>al suj\u016bd</i> portions of the Qur\u2019an were recited, and in the course of which existing believers worshipped, and outsiders who heard the message either walked away or remained (i.e. until dawn) and submitted to God. I suggest the interested student read from s\u016brah 50 onwards with these assertions in view in order to judge for himself how readily such a position comports with the text.

This is the only instance of the root (<i>h-j-d</i>) from which this word comes. Thus, we have nothing to compare with in the text, and the word is highly vulnerable to the type of lexical manipulations of Qur\u2019anic terms which characterise the Traditionalist\u2019s method. This word now means <i>relinquish sleep for prayer</i>. And a review of Lane\u2019s entry for the verb (p. 2940) shows the root of the verb to be firmly fixed in notions of <i>sleep</i> (either succumbing to it or refraining from it). Clearly, from the context at <a>17:79</a>, the latter is meant. I think it is safe to regard the Traditionalist\u2019s preferred emphasis on <i>prayer</i> (and here he means the prayer he can point to nowhere in the Qur\u2019an but which he insists is from God) as a case of culture affecting lexical sense over time. It is clear to see how this would have happened. In agreement with the non-sectarian Arabist A. J. Arberry I have used <i>vigil</i>, which emphasises wakefulness, but allows for worship and remembrance of God also. In the context of my view of <a>17:78</a>, the imperative here informs part of that process by which men were warned by means of the Qur\u2019an (see notes to <a>17:77</a> and <a>17:78</a>)."], ["17:79:2", "2.

This is possible only if one has already accepted a non-Qur\u2019anic value for <i>al \u1e63al\u0101t</i> at the hand of the Traditionalist. However, we can cross-reference <i>n\u0101fila</i>, since it occurs at one other place: <a>21:72</a>. There the context is Ya\u02bfq\u016bb being given to Ibr\u0101h\u012bm in <i>addition</i> to Is\u1e25\u0101q.

However, while the concept of <i>duration</i> is entirely consonant with the meaning and usage of the root in other places in the text, to my knowledge the Traditionalist does not claim that the Messenger stopped reciting the Qur\u2019an at the point new revelation ceased, nor would support for such a view be found in the Qur\u2019an. Thus, no matter what some Traditionalists imply or would have us infer here, the fact is the notion of <i>duration</i> implicit in this context could not mean what they would like it to (namely, the totality of the time over which the Qur\u2019an was sent down, claimed by them to be twenty-three years). And that much granted, the fact is that in this context any <i>duration</i> is more likely to refer to a humanly achievable unit of recitation (such as an hour or so), than to the value of twenty-three years taken from a non-Qur\u2019anic source. And if one agrees thus far, then what one means by <i>duration</i> and <i>intervals</i> becomes effectively the same thing.

While I render that way also in this edition, this point requires some elucidation. What it says is <i>fall down to the chins</i>.

Even the <i>promise</i> at <a>9:111</a> which references former scripture has the Day of Judgment firmly in view. And at <a>20:86</a>, in the case of M\u016bs\u0101, the <i>promise</i> mentioned refers back to verses <a>20:81-82</a> which treat of both blessings and <i>potential wrath</i>. Anyone who thinks that <a>40:55</a> does not fit into this scheme should read the whole of that chapter. Thus, the preponderance of evidence based on the Qur\u2019anic data for the meaning of <a>17:108</a> is that those speaking here recognise the reality of God\u2019s <i>promise</i> to mankind: Judgment is coming.

In its primary sense it is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at <a>1:1-7</a> of which the statement at <a>1:5</a> forms our part \u2014 commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every man has to acknowledge God\u2019s authority (see <a>7:172</a>). Worship \u2014 which is the value the Traditionalist insists upon here \u2014 is, doubtless, a duty; however, see <a>17:78</a> and note thereto. In the context here, the duty referred to is most readily identified in communication of the statements the recipient of the Qur\u2019an is given to say at <a>17:107-111</a>.

His conflation of two concepts is particularly effective in English, the speakers of which he has believing something he himself knows to be untrue: that <i>al \u1e63al\u0101t</i> (as he understands it) and <i>supplication</i> (i.e. an appeal to God for something) are basically the same thing. This has worked because he has told the English-speaking world that <i>al \u1e63al\u0101t</i> means <i>prayer</i>, and the mind of the English speaker provided the bridge from that assertion to what he \u2014 the native speaker of English \u2014 means by the term, (i.e. <i>supplication</i>).

So, even if one agrees with the Traditionalist\u2019s understanding of <i>al \u1e63al\u0101t</i> and with his view that the opening of the verse treats of supplication, this in no way suggests that these two processes are one thing, nor does it mean that this one thing is what the English speaker means by <i>prayer</i>.

It is perhaps significant that the calumny brought by many Christians over the centuries against God is mentioned at this point, just prior to the story of the companions of the cave (or The Seven Sleepers as Christian sources put it). Modern Christians typically have the impression that all early Christians were Trinitarians, but this is simply not the case; the first Christians were Judaeans and uncompromising monotheists. There certainly exists a story in a cave featuring Christians and set in Ephesus which predates the Qur\u2019an, and the fact that the Qur\u2019an features stories which were previously known is presented by its detractors as grounds to question its veracity or to accuse it of imitation. Such a position gains some traction over ignorant and inattentive audiences. However, the fact is that the Qur\u2019an both confirms and corrects a wide range of narratives as part of its <i>modus operandi</i>. If one can fault the facts that it confirms or corrects, that is one thing. But to criticise a message which itself states that it repeats and corrects known accounts \u2014 for doing exactly that \u2014 is a cheap shot designed to give audiences which are unlikely ever to consider the Qur\u2019an\u2019s arguments in context the impression that they have reliable grounds to disregard the Qur\u2019anic revelation <i>in toto</i>.

Any suggestion that the subjects of the current story were Trinitarian Christians is also implicitly corrected by the Qur\u2019an.

However, this interpretation is weak inasmuch as absence of knowledge does not necessarily imply an objective negation of the fact to which it relates. It is, therefore, obvious that bihi cannot signify \u201cof it\u201d: it signifies \u201cof Him\u201d, and relates to God. Hence, the phrase must be rendered as above - meaning that they who make such a preposterous claim have no real knowledge of Him, since they attribute to the Supreme Being something that is attributable only to created imperfect beings.

It remains the companions of the cave (which should come as no surprise since we are told at <a>18:19</a> that the entire point of the story is the debate between the companions of the cave). The verb, then, is not in the first person plural (<i>we</i>), it is in the third person masculine singular (<i>he</i>) taking a first person plural object <i>n\u0101</i> (<i>us</i>) then the preposition <i>\u02bfal\u0101</i> and the second object <i>them</i>. The companions of the cave are here stating why God acquainted them with the people of the town. In his haste to create a religion based on later fictions, the Traditionalist has lost \u2014 or perhaps wished not to retain \u2014 the point of the Qur\u2019anic narrative which is that we, the believers, are meant to warn those around us. It is not a job for commissioned messengers and prophets only; such a task is what following a messenger of God entails. The companions of the cave were simply doing their job; and their story concentrates on the post-op review in the cave. Understood thus, all requirements of the verb are met and nothing is \u2018suppressed\u2019, and we remain focused on the very point the Qur\u2019an tells us is central: the debate among the companions of the cave (<a>18:19</a>)."], ["18:21:4", "4.

Lit.: <i>He of the Two Horns</i> or <i>He of the Two Generations</i>. Muhammad Asad contributes the following thoughts here: <i>Lit., \u201cI will convey unto you a remembrance [or \u201cmention\u201d] of him\u201d - i.e., something that is worthy of remembrance and mention: which, I believe, is an allusion to the parabolic character of the subsequent story and the fact that it is confined, like the preceding parable of Moses and the unknown sage, to a few fundamental, spiritual truths. - The epithet Dhu\u2019l-Qarnayn signifies \u201cthe Two-Horned One\u201d or \u201cHe of the Two Epochs\u201d, since the noun qarn has the meaning of \u201chorn\u201d as well as of \u201cgeneration\u201d or \u201cepoch\u201d or \u201cage\u201d or \u201ccentury\u201d. The classical commentators incline to the first of these meanings (\u201cthe Two-Horned\u201d); and in this they appear to have been influenced by the ancient Middle-Eastern imagery of \u201chorns\u201d as symbols of power and greatness, although the Qur\u2019an itself does not offer any warrant for this interpretation. In fact, the term qarn (and its plural qurun) occurs in the Qur\u2019an - apart from the combination Dhu\u2019l-Qarnayn appearing in verses 83, 86 and 94 of this surah - twenty times: and each time it has the meaning of \u201cgeneration\u201d in the sense of people belonging to one particular epoch or civilization. However, since the allegory of Dhu\u2019l-Qarnayn is meant to illustrate the qualities of a powerful and just ruler, it is possible to assume that this designation is an echo of the above-mentioned ancient symbolism, which - being familiar to the Arabs from very early times - had acquired idiomatic currency in their language long before the advent of Islam. Within the context of our Qur\u2019anic allegory, the \u201ctwo horns\u201d may be taken to denote the two sources of power with which Dhu\u2019l-Qarnayn is said to have been endowed: namely, the worldly might and prestige of kingship as well as the spiritual strength resulting from his faith in God. This last point is extremely important - for it is precisely the Qur\u2019anic stress on his faith in God that makes it impossible to identify Dhu \u2018l-Qarnayn, as most of the commentators do, with Alexander the Great (who is represented on some of his coins with two horns on his head) or with one or another of the pre-Islamic, Himyaritic kings of Yemen. All those historic personages were pagans and worshipped a plurality of deities as a matter of course, whereas our Dhu \u2018l-Qarnayn is depicted as a firm believer in the One God: indeed, it is this aspect of his personality that provides the innermost reason of the Qur\u2019anic allegory. We must, therefore, conclude that the latter has nothing to do with history or even legend, and that its sole purport is a parabolic discourse on faith and ethics, with specific reference to the problem of worldly power.</i>"], ["18:83:2", "2:200:2"], ["18:84:1", "12:66:1"], ["18:84:2", "2.

The word <i>ka</i><i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> means <i>thus</i> and occurs many times in the Qur\u2019an. In the majority of cases it fits perfectly within the narrative. However, I noticed that in a small number of cases it neither fits fully syntactically nor has any obvious function. Translators struggle to accommodate it in such cases by ignoring it, twisting it, or inserting words of their own choosing to form a non-existent and non-functioning thought such as: <i>thus [it was]</i> or <i>thus [it came to pass]</i>, treating the reader to the literary equivalent of <i>ho-hum</i> or <i>well then</i> \u2014 certainly not representative of the terse and compact vitality which one experiences with the Qur\u2019an. I reviewed and listed every instance of <i>ka</i><i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> and identified those cases in which they \u2018hang\u2019 (or seem lost or disjointed from the context). That process rendered a set comprising: <a>18:91</a>, <a>26:59</a>, <a>44:28</a>, <a>44:54</a>. (The reader is encouraged to look at and compare a number of translations to see how the translators wrestle to make the word fit; where they deal with it honestly it lies there like a second spare tyre next to a fully packed car.) Having identified the set, I read the surrounding context for each and found that they all treat of the same themes: security in, and inheritance or possession of, land or kingdom. In order: <a>18:91</a> treats of Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn who encounters a people who have nothing but the sun above their heads (they have neither security nor possession of the land) and in the next verse the narrative turns to the story of Ya\u2019j\u016bj and Ma\u2019j\u016bj due to whom those he encounters are unable to live unmolested in the land \u2014 which condition he remedies (they possess a land but have not security \u2014 although they gain it); at <a>26:59</a> the children of Israel inherit <i>\u2018treasures and a noble station\u2019</i> and are delivered through the sea (leaving behind slavery and tyranny) while those who oppressed them are destroyed (so the children of Israel had neither security nor possession but they gain both along with inheritance); <a>44:28</a> treats of Fir\u02bfawn and his people and lists the good that they had, before stating: <i>\u2018[...]We gave it as an inheritance to another people\u2019</i> and <i>\u2018[...]the heaven and the earth wept not for them, nor were they granted respite\u2019</i> (so they had both security and possession but lost everything and utterly failed in the end); the final instance is found at <a>44:54</a> and treats of those of prudent fear, and sits in the middle of <a>44:51-57</a>, a passage which describes the bliss of the Garden where the inhabitants are <i>\u2018in a secure station\u2019</i> and will <i>\u2018not taste therein of death save the former death[...]\u2019</i> \u2014 a passage which itself follows on from, and stands in stark contradistinction to, a description of the fate of the inhabitants of Hell (so in this case they have the supreme security and possession, and can never lose it). Given the totality of the above facts, I must regard these \u2018extra\u2019 <i>ka</i><i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s as having logistical as well as semantic functions, operating with a function similar to <i>kall\u0101</i> (see note to <a>74:16</a>) as pan-textual markers which draw together points spread across the broader narrative \u2014 a fact which indicates that their surrounding contexts should be considered together. Given what we now know, the statement immediately following the first instance of this <i>ka</i><i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> set at <a>18:91</a> takes on an entirely different aspect. Translators struggle to dispatch this instance with conviction because they (quite reasonably) assume it treats of Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn, and when understood as such it means, frankly, nothing \u2014 or at least nothing we can do anything with. However, it fits perfectly into the model just outlined. Saheeh International renders the clause: <i>\u2018And We had encompassed [all] that he had in knowledge.\u2019</i> The Arabic rendered here <i>he had</i> is <i>ladayhi</i> which means (in the context) <i>he has</i> (or <i>he had</i>) <i>with him</i> or <i>near him is</i> (or <i>was</i>). The case is now clear that the statement refers not to Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn but to the use of the hanging <i>ka</i><i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika: And We have encompassed all that it (i.e. the hanging ka</i><i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika) has (i.e. is with it, near it) in knowledge.</i> All instances appear in the notes and reference this verse.

There is no justification that I can find for Traditionalist translations here using <i>mountains</i> and synonyms. This noun occurs only once, a fact which makes it vulnerable to abuse for the usual reasons. The verb form occurs at <a>6:46</a>, <a>6:157</a>, <a>6:157</a>, <a>6:157</a> and means <i>to turn away</i> (in a reflexive, not transitive sense). The story here, as commonly understood, is that a wall was built between two mountains to keep Ya\u2019j\u016bj and Ma\u2019j\u016bj at bay. But I do not agree that this is what the text says. Rather, it seems to be yet another case of ideology driving interpretation. There are strong, internally verifiable words for <i>mountain</i> in the Qur\u2019an but <i>\u1e63adaf</i> is not one of them; such a value also makes no sense in the context: if a wall is erected across a valley and there exists a compelling reason to get past it, it is a simple matter to climb up one side of the mountain and down the other side of the barrier. In any case, I do not believe this is what is described here. The preceding language concerns building a <i>dam</i>, filling until <i>making level</i> and <i>pouring</i>. This does not sound like building upwards, rather blocking downwards or inwards. My thesis is this: Ya\u2019j\u016bj and Ma\u2019j\u016bj were cave-dwellers and Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn is blocking the entrance to their subterranean domain. In such a scenario <i>\u1e63adaf</i> bears a reasonable correlation to the action in both its noun and verb aspects. The verb means <i>to turn away</i>, which is what cave-dwellers have traditionally done with regard to the world. The noun\u2019s meanings have in common the concept of <i>an aperture or opening which serves as an entrance to something which itself burrows into the inner parts of a thing</i>. On this basis, I believe that <i>opening</i> is the right interpretation here. In this scenario, Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn is not building a wall between one faction and another. He is sealing Ya\u2019j\u016bj and Ma\u2019j\u016bj alive into a mass tomb. On this basis verses <a>18:98-99</a> make sense also.

A review of these verses will confirm that what is meant here is the Day in which God Almighty arises. The point Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn is making is that the tomb they have created for Ya\u2019j\u016bj and Ma\u2019j\u016bj will not withstand the end of the world, and that Ya\u2019j\u016bj and Ma\u2019j\u016bj, like every other creature, will be brought forth to Judgment; he is simply putting the work of his hands into right context with respect to the power and judgment of God.

According to one of the explanations advanced by Tabari and Zamakhshari, it signifies \u201ca man of the Jewish clan of the Samirah\u201d, i.e., the ethnic and religious group designated in later times as the Samaritans (a small remnant of whom is still living in Nablus, in Palestine). Since that sect as such did not yet exist at the time of Moses, it is possible that - as Ibn \u2018Abbas maintained (Razi) - the person in question was one of the many Egyptians who had been converted to the faith of Moses and joined the Israelites on their exodus from Egypt: in which case the designation samiri might be connected with the ancient Egyptian shemer, \u201ca foreigner\u201d or \u201cstranger\u201d. This surmise is strengthened by his introduction of the worship of the golden calf, undoubtedly an echo of the Egyptian cult of Apis. In any case, it is not impossible that the latter-day Samaritans descended - or were reputed to descend - from this personality, whether of Hebrew or of Egyptian origin; this might partly explain the persistent antagonism between them and the rest of the Israelite community.</i> Another line of reasoning identifies <i>s\u0101miriyy</i> with Zimr\u012b (Hebrew: \u05d6\u05b4\u05de\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9, lit. \u201c<i>praiseworthy</i>\u201d) son of Salu, the prince or leader of a family within the Tribe of Simeon during the time of the Israelites\u2019 Exodus."], ["20:86:1", "1.

This \u201cborrowing\u201d was obviously done under false pretences, without any intention on the part of the Israelites to return the jewellery to its rightful owners: for, according to the Biblical statement (ibid., verse 36), \u201cthey spoiled [i.e., robbed] the Egyptians\u201d by doing so.

In the earliest copies of the Qur\u2019an the spelling was apparently confined, in this instance, to the consonants q-l: hence the possibility of reading it either as qul or as qala. However, as Tabari points out, both these readings have the same meaning and are, therefore, equally valid, \u201cfor, when God bade Muhammad to say this, he [undoubtedly] said it... Hence, in whichever way this word is read, the reader is correct (musib as-sawab) in his reading.\u201d Among the classical commentators, Baghawi and Baydawi explicitly use the spelling qul, while Zamakhshari\u2019s short remark that \u201cit has also been read as qala\u201d seems to indicate his own preference for the imperative qul.</i> The topic here is suggestive of a much larger one: that the diacritical adornment to the <i>\u1e25ur\u016bf</i> (letters) are in places interpretive, and may be contested on the basis of context or common sense (cf. <a>39:18</a>).

When we assemble key features of the history of that mission on the basis of the text, it is clear that the original community to which Muhammad preached was itself annihilated (see my work <i><a>The God Protocol</a></i>). Those who today claim stewardship over the history of the period have a narrative, but that narrative does not work outwards from the Qur\u2019an on the basis of its contents; rather, it works inwards to it on the basis of ideological requirements and conclusions taken from elsewhere as part of the larger project of making the Qur\u2019an seem to contain a religion which, in truth, it does not. The mental energy required to ignore the obvious conflicts between that religion\u2019s narrative and what is contained in the book it claims as its foundational scripture is the price of membership of the religion, and its dominance over normative mental faculties and standards of investigation regarded as piety by its adherents.

This formula resists translation into English in a manner which is both consistent and natural across each of its three instances (<a>21:17</a>, <a>21:79</a>, <a>21:104</a>), as the context is different in each case. The full import of the core of this formula might be allowed a freer rendition into English as: <i>We are ever</i> (or <i>were ever</i>) <i>doers [of what We will]</i>. This is the sense. So what is meant here by <i>developing motif</i>? We mean that while the core of the formula (<i>kunn\u0101 f\u0101\u02bfil\u012bna</i>) remains fixed, the word linking it to the main text is different in each case, and this variance effects a <i>development</i> of the motif.

Thus, the motif goes from conveying the conditional (<i>if x be the case</i>), to the enumerative (<i>and x is the case</i>), to the emphatic (<i>truly x is the case</i>). As a result, this motif grows in significance as we progress through the s\u016brah. To lose this formula in the process of translation is to deprive the reader of the s\u016brah of its chorus.

However, here and in many places across the text, <i>am</i> exists without a contextual setup or corollary (e.g. <i>Or coffee?</i>). Clearly, this does not fully make sense. The translators wriggle and try to explain, but not convincingly. Sometimes by sticking with <i>or</i> \u2014 or by replacing or ignoring it \u2014 they stumble upon sense because the surrounding text happens to fall kindly for them. But where they are true to their dominant premises they are left often with an awkward <i>non sequitur</i>. My process was this: I identified all cases of <i>am</i> in the text, placing them in one of two categories: those which perform the standard offices of <i>or</i> (e.g. Would you like tea <i>or</i> coffee?), and those which do not, those which have no natural preceding part (e.g. <i>Or</i> coffee?). This latter category I call the \u2018hanging <i>am</i>\u2019. Upon reviewing all cases of the hanging <i>am</i> it became clear that the fact that <i>am</i> exists also in this second state indicates not a deficiency, but rather the presence of a separate textual entity. The Traditionalist has failed to understand the point and purpose of the hanging <i>am</i> which is why, in part, his translation reads in such a stalling, faltering way where it occurs. Its function, however, is twofold: rhetorical and logistical. It is rhetorical in that it identifies a key claim or scenario prior to answering or clarifying that claim or scenario, operating like a Q&amp;A sheet. Its logistical function consists in the fact that the hanging <i>am</i> operates as a marker, so that all such Q&amp;As may readily be identified and drawn together, thus providing an illuminating study as well as a reference guide for fielding common questions.

Arabic: <i>al \u1e63al\u0101t</i>; i.e. such duty as is incumbent. See note to <a>2:3</a> and <a>Article SZC</a>. Before discussing the nature of this instance of <i>al \u1e63al\u0101t</i> in the text, we will consider the dynamics of the verse overall. If we take the Traditionalist\u2019s own values as binding, the verse can only be tautologous. And, conversely, for the sense not be tautologous, the Traditionalist\u2019s values must be incorrect. To explain: the Traditionalist has it that <i>al \u1e63al\u0101t</i> is \u2018worship\u2019 (albeit worship of a very specific nature the details of which he derives from later hearsay ascribed to Mu\u1e25ammad, and insists upon as the Qur\u2019anic value); he also has it that <i>\u02bfib\u0101da</i> (here in a verbal form: \u2018<i>they served us</i>\u2019) is \u2018worship\u2019. And by \u2018worship\u2019 he means the same thing (at least to a large extent) as he means by <i>al \u1e63al\u0101t</i>. Therein lies a tautology. And even if we stretch the meaning of <i>\u02bfib\u0101da</i> to embrace the meaning given to it by later jurists (i.e. performance of the five pillars of a religion called Islam) and allow the last line to summarise what precedes, the Traditionalist is still in a bind because only two of his \u2018pillars\u2019 are present (and he can point nowhere in the Qur\u2019an at \u2018<i>al khayr\u0101t</i>\u2019 \u2014 good deeds \u2014 having a value equal to the missing three). Finally, if the Traditionalist attempts to wriggle out by citing a context that treats of pre-Islamic peoples, that move necessarily locks him out of his own claim (rejected vigorously by those who follow the Torah) that the \u2018pillars\u2019 of the Traditionalist\u2019s religion are materially the same thing as what was practised by the Hebrew followers of M\u016bs\u0101\u2019s Torah. We can summarise the narrative which precedes the point at which \u2018<i>leaders</i>\u2019 is mentioned in <a>21:73</a> as follows: <a>21:1-5</a> (impending destruction; heedlessness of men); <a>21:6-15</a> (former messengers; previous cases of destruction); <a>21:16-29</a> (absolute monotheism is reality); <a>21:30-33</a> (appeals to Creation); <a>21:34-40</a> (mortality of messenger; haste of man; reality of Hell); <a>21:41-47</a> (appeals to past, to death, and to Judgment). At this juncture mention of former believing notables begins: <a>21:48-50</a> (M\u016bs\u0101 and H\u0101r\u016bn: the Division; fear of the Hour); <a>21:51-70</a> (Ibr\u0101h\u012bm\u2019s witness to God alone against his people); <a>21:71</a> (L\u016b\u1e6d, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm\u2019s nephew); <a>21:72</a> (Is\u1e25\u0101q, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm\u2019s son, and Ya\u02bfq\u016bb, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm\u2019s grandson). The \u2018<i>them</i>\u2019 of <a>21:73</a> can only logically refer to these men \u2014 or to those which follow (see note to <a>21:24</a> for a full list). Yet nowhere in what precedes or follows this point in the present s\u016brah do we find support for the Traditionalist\u2019s values for <i>al \u1e63al\u0101t</i> (namely, performance of a five-time daily ritual) or for <i>al zak\u0101t</i> (payment of % yearly tax on one\u2019s substance). Rather, the emphasis in the sequence is on belief in God alone and the Last Day, and actions based thereupon (which is the core of our value for <i>al \u1e63al\u0101t</i>). Additionally, a central plank of the value we assert in this work for <i>al zak\u0101t</i> is the observance of <i>legal sexual intercourse</i> (<i>purity</i>) and we can point to the following in support of that value: L\u016b\u1e6d\u2019s mission was characterised by calling men away from sinful sexual behaviour (<a>21:74-75</a>); N\u016b\u1e25 (mentioned at <a>21:76</a>) was victim of gross sexual misconduct, not the perpetrator of it (<a>11:45-46</a>); D\u0101w\u016bd fell sexually (according to the Hebrew scriptures; a point contested but unconvincingly so by the Traditionalist), mentioned here at <a>21:78</a> (which points to <a>38:17-26</a>), but was chastened and improved as a result (Sulaym\u0101n himself was the legitimate fruit of his father\u2019s initially illegitimate union with his mother). We can point also to the sexual and general fidelity of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm (though sorely tested while awaiting offspring); likewise to that of Is\u1e25\u0101q (whose wife Rebecca did not conceive until later in life). Finally, we can point to Maryam whose defining characteristic in the Qur\u2019an is <i>chastity</i> (i.e. of eschewing immoral sexual activities \u2014 see <a>21:91</a> and note thereto). Thus, while one can argue on the basis of scripture that God instructed those listed in this s\u016brah in the upholding of duty (i.e. to cleave to and bear witness to God alone), and in the maintenance of (sexual) purity, it is simply not possible to assert that they kept the Traditionalist\u2019s prayer regimen or paid the tax he claims is obligatory. The Traditionalist\u2019s claims create dissonance and tautology, do not comport with what we find in the local context, find no support in the rest of the Qur\u2019an, and require the Traditionalist to accuse adherents of the Torah of possessing his values for <i>al \u1e63al\u0101t</i> and <i>al zak\u0101t</i> but <i>hiding</i> them. The underlying cause of all of this is the Traditionalist\u2019s duplication of the very sin he (rightly) criticises the Rabbinic Jews of: writing with his own hand stories he ascribes to a prophet of God. If we look to the Qur\u2019an rather than to the Traditionalist\u2019s \u2018Mishnah\u2019 for answers, this conflict evaporates."], ["21:73:3", "3. Arabic: <i>al zak\u0101t</i>.

The expression dhu \u2018l-kifl is derived from the verb kafala and especially the form takaffala - which signifies \u201che became responsible [for something or someone]\u201d or \u201cpledged himself [to do something]\u201d. Although the classical commentators consider dhu \u2018l-kifl to be the epithet or the proper name of a particular prophet - whom they variously, more or less at random, identify with Elijah or Joshua or Zachariah or Ezekiel - I fail to see any reason whatever for such attempts at \u201cidentification\u201d[...]. I am, therefore, of the opinion that we have here (as in the identical expression in <a>38:48</a>) a generic term applying to every one of the prophets, inasmuch as each of them pledged himself unreservedly to God and accepted the responsibility for delivering His message to man.</i> Abdullah Yusuf Ali takes the other (and more popular view), and I include his comment here for the sake of completion: <i>Dhu al Kifl would literally mean \u201cpossessor of, or giving, a double requital or portion\u201d; or else, \u201cone who used a cloak of double thickness,\u201d that being one of the meanings of Kifl. The Commentators differ in opinion as to who is meant, why the title is applied to him, and the point of his being grouped with Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl and Idris for constancy and patience. I think the best suggestion is that afforded by Karsten Niebuhr in his Reisebeschreibung nach Arabien, Copenhagen, 1778, <a>2:264-266</a>, as quoted in the Encyclopaedia of Islam under \u201cDhu al Kifl\u201d. He visited Meshed</i> \u2019<i>Ah in Iraq, and also the little town called Kefil, midway between Najaf and Hillah (Babylon). Kefil, he says, is the Arabic form of Ezekiel. The shrine of Ezekiel was there, and the Jews came to it on a pilgrimage. If we accept \u201cDhu al Kifl\u201d to be not an epithet, but an Arabicised form of \u201cEzekiel\u201d, it fits the context. Ezekiel was a prophet in Israel who was carried away to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar after his second attack on Jerusalem (about B.C. 599). His Book is included in the English Bible (Old Testament). He was chained and bound, and put into prison, and for a time he was dumb, (Ezekiel, <a>3:25-26</a>). He bore it all with patience and constancy, and continued to reprove boldly the evils in Israel. In a burning passage he denounces false leaders in words which are eternally true: \u201cWoe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, you kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock. The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken . . .\u201d, etc. (Ezekiel, <a>34:2-4</a>). Dhu al Kifl is again mentioned in <a>38:48</a> along with Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl and Elisha.</i>"], ["21:85:2", "3:142:2"], ["21:87:1", "1. Or <i>the man of the fish</i>.

He was the prophet raised to warn the Assyrian capital Nineveh[...] His story is told in <a>37:139-149</a>. When his first warning was unheeded by the people, he denounced God\u2019s wrath on them. But they repented and God forgave them for the time being. Jonah, meanwhile, departed in wrath, discouraged at the apparent failure of his mission. He should have remained in the most discouraging circumstances, and relied on the power of God; for God had power both over Nineveh and over the Messenger He had sent to Nineveh. He went away to the sea and took a ship, but apparently the sailors threw him out as a man of bad omen in a storm. He was swallowed by a big Fish (or Whale), but in the depth of the darkness, he cried to God and confessed his weakness. The \u201cdarkness\u201d may be interpreted both physically and spiritually; physically, as the darkness of the night and the storm and the Fish\u2019s body; spiritually as the darkness in his soul, his extreme distress in the situation which he had brought on himself. God Most Gracious forgave him. He was cast out ashore; he was given the shelter of a plant in his state of physical and mental lassitude. He was refreshed and strengthened, and the work of his mission prospered. Thus he overcame all his disappointment by repentance and Faith, and God accepted him.</i>"], ["21:87:2", "2.

As a matter of fact, the Qur\u2019an uses the same expression in three other places with reference to the creation of man in general - namely in <a>15:29</a> and <a>38:72</a>, \u201cwhen I have formed him... and breathed into him of My spirit\u201d; and in <a>32:9</a>, \u201cand thereupon He forms [lit., \u201cformed\u201d] him fully and breathes lit., \u201cbreathed\u201d] into him of His spirit\u201d.

Commenting on the verse under consideration, Zamakhshari states that \u201cthe breathing of the spirit [of God] into a body signifies the endowing it with life\u201d: an explanation with which Razi concurs. As for the description of Mary as allati ahsanat farjaha; idiomatically denoting \u201cone who guarded her chastity\u201d (lit., \u201cher private parts\u201d), it is to be borne in mind that the term ihsan - lit., \u201c[one\u2019s] being fortified [against any danger or evil]\u201d - has the tropical meaning of \u201cabstinence from what is unlawful or reprehensible\u201d (Taj al-\u2019Arus), and especially from illicit sexual intercourse, and is applied to a man as well as a woman: thus, for instance, the terms muhsan and muhsanah are used elsewhere in the Qur\u2019an to describe, respectively, a man or a woman who is \u201cfortified [by marriage] against unchastity\u201d. Hence, the expression allati ahsanat farjaha, occurring in the above verse as well as in <a>66:12</a> with reference to Mary, is but meant to stress her outstanding chastity and complete abstinence, in thought as well as in deed, from anything unlawful or morally reprehensible: in other words, a rejection of the calumny (referred to in <a>4:156</a> and obliquely alluded to in <a>19:27-28</a>) that the birth of Jesus was the result of an \u201cillicit union\u201d.</i>"], ["21:91:3", "2:145:3"], ["21:92:1", "1.

On a related point, I have wondered why, given that Psalms 37 is quoted in the Qur\u2019an, the Traditionalist is so little interested in its contents. I believe I have the answer: it is because its contents are inconvenient to his broader project. Consider that Psalms <a>37:11</a> reads: \u05d5\u05e2\u05e0\u05d5\u05d9\u05dd \u05d9\u05d9\u05e8\u05e9\u05d5\u05be\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05d5\u05d4\u05ea\u05e2\u05e0\u05d2\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc\u05be\u05e8\u05d1 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd\u05c3 (But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace), while Psalms <a>37:37</a> reads: \u05e9\u05de\u05e8\u05be\u05ea\u05dd \u05d5\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8 \u05db\u05d9\u05be\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea \u05dc\u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd (Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.) The word in both verses rendered peace (Hebrew: shalowm) is based on the same root from which musl\u012bm and isl\u0101m are formed in the Arabic of the Qur\u2019an.

Later expansions on the meaning of <i>dh</i><i>ikr</i> as part of cultural development notwithstanding (from bead-counting meditations to claimed titles for entire books), the Qur\u2019an\u2019s own use of the term is more localised, tending to indicate <i>histories</i>, either collective or individual, or the <i>remembrance</i> (the deeds, power, or promises) of God.

The additional analysis there necessitated further analysis of all <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s in the present s\u016brah on a pan-textual basis. That revealed a minor tension between <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika bianna</i> and both my previous translation of <i>because</i> and that found among other translators \u2014 typically: <i>that is because</i>. (I am aware, naturally, that Classical lexicons support the typical translation of <i>that is because</i>, or even of <i>that is due to the fact that</i>; what interests me is the formula\u2019s function on a Qur\u2019anic pan-textual basis.) The minor tension I mention arises since <i>that is because</i> should provide a link of plain causation between a preceding statement and what follows, yet that expectation is imperfectly met in some cases (consider as examples <a>2:176</a>, <a>8:53</a>, <a>9:6</a>, <a>9:120</a>, <a>22:6</a>, <a>22:61</a>, <a>22:62</a>, <a>31:30</a>, <a>47:3</a>). I am not saying the standard value for <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika bianna</i> statements is wildly off; I am saying it is <i>somewhat</i> off and missing a minor component. Further, a number of <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika bianna</i> statements are followed by <i>anna</i> statements (i.e. statements which beat the same drum as the preceding <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika bianna</i> statement). This is the case here at <a>22:6</a>. By using <i>that is because</i> the only way to retain the beat of subsequent <i>anna</i> statements is to repeat <i>because</i> (which is inelegant), or to ignore them altogether. The translation by Saheeh International of <a>22:6-7</a> illustrates a deeper problem: <i>That is because All\u0101h is the Truth and because He gives life to the dead and because He is over all things competent / And [that they may know] that the Hour is coming \u2014 no doubt about it \u2014 and that All\u0101h will resurrect those in the graves.</i> (Note: lower-case instances of <i>that</i> outside of parenthesis in the quoted verses correspond with the final two <i>anna</i> statements.) The problem is that the text runs off the rails of the initial trajectory set up by the opening <i>That is because</i>. But <a>22:6-7</a> is a single argument comprising five points, four of which relate to the opening <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika bianna</i> by means of <i>anna</i> statements. And <a>22:5</a> itself is a detailed and compelling argument. But <a>22:6</a> does not follow <a>22:5</a> in the frictionless way a <i>that is because</i> statement in English implies. For <a>22:6</a> to follow seamlessly from <a>22:5</a>, <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika bianna</i> must do more than provide a link to what precedes and establish causation (both of which duties are provided by <i>that is because</i>), it must also supply <i>an</i> <i>exposition of what precedes</i>. Without the quality of exposition, the elements of linkage and causation fall flat rather than resound. Here, for example, the narrative function of <a>22:6</a> must be to build upon the list of statements which comprise <a>22:5</a>, but the tones <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika bianna</i> needs to sound are rendered mute by the pedestrian <i>that is because</i> value. What is supposed to be a logical progression becomes two statements stapled together with <i>that is because</i>. Again, I am not saying the <i>that is because</i> value is entirely wrong. I am saying it is missing something; like listening to a passage of music on the bass and mid-range channels only, with the treble channel zeroed out. To illustrate by means of a simple case: <i>He plants flowers. / That is because flowers are beautiful</i>. The two statements are linked, and causation is established between them. However, there is no sense in which there is an exposition or development of the first statement by that which follows, no call to broader consideration of the primary statement in the light of the secondary statement (which I assert as the missing \u2018range\u2019)<i>.</i> But we can retain all functions (linking, causation, and exposition) by means of: <i>He plants flowers / For it is that flowers are beautiful!</i> Here the <i>because</i> component is implicit to the structure; the two statement are clearly linked; and the second part is an exposition and development of the first. Moreover, any further points \u2014 that is <i>anna</i> statements \u2014 are easily added by means of <i>and that[...]!</i> It may be felt that the difference between <i>that is because</i> and <i>for it is that</i> is minimal; and I would agree. Yet there is a shift in nuance, one which preserves a register which is lost under the typical construction. We note that <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika bianna</i> occurs in s\u016brah 47 more times than in any other (a total of five), and that it occurs in close succession on two occasions (at <a>22:61</a> and <a>22:62</a>, and at <a>59:13</a> and <a>59:14</a>).

The Traditionalist frequently assumes \u2014 and wishes the reader to assume \u2014 that the imperative mood has switched to Mu\u1e25ammad at the beginning of <a>22:27</a>, but there is no strong indication of that, no use of such standard markers as \u2018<i>Say thou</i>\u2019 or \u2018<i>O Prophet!\u2019</i> or \u2018<i>O messenger!\u2019</i>. Whereas Muhammad Asad is clear on where he stands \u2014 he renders here: <i>Hence, [O Muhammad], proclaim thou unto all people the [duty of] pilgrimage \u2014</i> most Traditionalist translators are more subtle. While they build their assumptions quietly into their presentations, their treatment of <a>22:28</a> leaves us in no doubt that they have subtly made the same inference at <a>22:27</a> that Muhammad Asad had the honesty to trumpet; for example Hilali &amp; Khan\u2019s rendering of <a>22:28</a> reads: <i>That they may witness things that</i> <i>are</i> <i>of benefit to them (i.e. reward of Hajj in the Hereafter, and also some worldly gain from trade, etc.), and mention the Name of Allah on appointed days (i.e. 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th day of Dh\u016bl-Hijjah), over the beast of cattle that He has provided for them (for sacrifice) (at the time of their slaughtering by saying: Bismillah, WAllahu-Akbar, Allahumma Minka wa Ilaik). Then eat thereof and feed therewith the poor who have a very hard time</i>. What the Traditionalist calls the <i>\u1e25ajj</i> is one of the five pillars of his religion. He is very clear on that. If even one pillar is dislodged, his entire operation is at an end. The portions of the text he can construe to create the impression that his \u2018pillar\u2019 of <i>hajj</i> is native to the Qur\u2019an are minimal. He must wring from what is available to him as much seeming correspondence as he can between his externally derived rituals and the text. This explains his impatience to transport the narrative to the time of Mu\u1e25ammad. However, on a more objective basis, while it is clear that the verses at <a>22:27-28</a> have an application both to Ibr\u0101h\u012bm and to Mu\u1e25ammad (and that the focus switches from the one to the other), the earliest point at which a shift can be objectively determined comes at <a>22:28</a> with the statement <i>So eat thereof</i>. The shift to the imperative plural indicates a clear adjustment from one narrative frame to another. The alternative is that Muhammad Asad is right in his reading (see above). But for that position to be tenable, one would need to point to overwhelming textual proof of a shift from the imperative singular of <a>22:26</a> (treating of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm) to an imperative singular at <a>22:27</a> treating of Mu\u1e25ammad.

However, if one accepts <i>distant</i> as the value for <i>\u02bfam\u012bq</i> (see note above), this argument loses force. But there are further considerations here.

Thus, <i>min kulli fajjin \u02bfam\u012bq</i> today can be used to mean <i>from all sides, from all directions, from everywhere.</i> In any case, the text treats here of directives given to Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, and today the Traditionalist\u2019s sole supposedly Qur\u2019anic evidence connecting the father of the great monotheistic religions with Mecca is a theatrical prop he calls <i>maqam ibrahim</i> \u2014 something which performs the offices of idol and religious \u2018artefact\u2019, and which an eight-year-old schoolboy would not accept as proof of any kind."], ["22:28:1", "1.

That site is now closed (see <a>9:28</a> and note thereto), and I see no reason why its interest to us today should be greater than that of other locations in which the historical dramas the Qur\u2019an includes are set.

The Traditionalist (and other) translators fumble for meaning with particular <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s in this chapter (<a>22:30</a>, <a>22:32</a>, <a>22:60</a>). They interpolate and guess on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, but neither convincingly nor with conviction. For example, at <a>22:30</a> A. J. Arberry has: <i>All that;</i> Saheeh International has: <i>That [has been commanded],</i> Muhammad Asad has: <i>All this [is ordained by God]</i>; and Hilali &amp; Khan have: <i>That (Manasik prescribed duties of Hajj is the obligation that mankind owes to Allah).</i> At <a>22:32</a> A.

J. Arberry has: <i>All that;</i> Saheeh International has: <i>That [is so].</i> Muhammad Asad has: <i>Thus shall it be.</i> And, finally, Hilali &amp; Khan have: <i>That is so.</i> This is how these translators treat the exact same word at <a>22:30</a>, <a>22:32</a>, <a>22:60</a>. Clearly, <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> here is something of an extra spare wheel. Everyone understands that something has to be done with it; the question is what. At one end of the ideological spectrum, non-sectarian A. J. Arberry opts for unassuming consistency with <i>All that</i>, (though we have no way of knowing what <i>All that,</i> is). At the other, the highly doctrinaire Sunni Traditionalist translators Hilali &amp; Khan are out to tell you exactly what <i>All that</i> is \u2014 and it is that they and their religion are critical to understanding the segment. What we can say with certainty in the light of the above is that what we shall be calling the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s (<a>22:30</a>, <a>22:32</a>, <a>22:60</a>) are <i>elliptical</i>; that is, they imply information which has been elided but which we are meant to deduce. The question is only what exactly the nature of that elided information is, and whether or not we can correctly identify it. Before we attend to that process, we need to be sure we understand the Traditionalist\u2019s motivations. Objectively, the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s (<a>22:30</a>, <a>22:32</a>, <a>22:60</a>) ill fit the surrounding text and create an ungainly stumble in the textual flow that translators do not know what to do with. But why could not the Traditionalist be satisfied with the type of opaque consistency as satisfied non-sectarian A. J. Arberry, creating the textual equivalent of <i>O well</i>, or <i>Ho-hum</i>? The answer is that the segment at <a>22:26-37</a> is one of a limited number of places available to the Traditionalist where he can \u2014 in fact, he <i>must</i> \u2014 leverage the text as far as possible to create the impression in the mind of the reader that his religion is native to the Qur\u2019anic text. Without that, his religion can be dismissed as cut from entirely different cloth. But of equal importance to him is the fact that the segment is susceptible to his application of highly specialised \u2018<i>religious</i>\u2019 values to rarely occurring words. In this case, he makes much of particular \u2018<i>religious</i>\u2019 rites (but see <a>22:34</a>), for all details of which we are to trust him and his non-Qur\u2019anic literature. Since the terms to which he has affixed his specious definitions in the segment are either unique or extremely rare to the text as a whole, he has been able to claim his values knowing that nothing in the Qur\u2019anic text directly contradicts him. Thus, by inertia, his highly specialised definitions have stuck, both in the minds of translators and in the minds of readers. But the first and most obvious weakness for the Traditionalist here is that his value for the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s is different in each case. That ill fits with the fact that the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s are themselves identical in each case. But that neither proves wrong his claims nor improves upon his interpolations. To do that we must consider the textual evidence methodically, critically, and pan-textually. So let us begin with what we know. It is a fact that three instances of <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> in the present <i></i>s\u016brah <i></i>(<a>22:30</a>, <a>22:32</a>, <a>22:60</a>) ill fit the surrounding text. Under the methodology practiced here, this characteristic invites deeper investigation. And if the reader wishes to review examples where conspicuous features of the text have both stimulated investigation and yielded rich exegetical insight, he should consider the cases of <i>ka</i><i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> (see note to <a>18:91</a>), <i>kall\u0101</i> (see note to <a>74:16</a>), and <i>am</i> (see note to <a>21:21</a>). We also know that <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> is common to the broader text (it occurs a total of 280 times in this precise form), and is found 11 times in the present s\u016brah (<a>22:6</a>, <a>22:10</a>, <a>22:11</a>, <a>22:12</a>, <a>22:30</a>, <a>22:32</a>, <a>22:60</a>, <a>22:61</a>, <a>22:62</a>, <a>22:70</a>, <a>22:70</a>). If we consider the 11 <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s of this s\u016brah we note first that the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s occur in an unbroken sequence (<a>22:30</a>, <a>22:32</a>, <a>22:60</a>), insomuch as no other instance of <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> divides them. Next we see that this discrete subset of three \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s falls precisely at the midpoint of the sequence, with four instances of <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> occurring both prior to it and following it. Next we see that each cluster of four <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s <i></i>either side of the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 set of three, itself comprises two double clusters of two <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s (<a>22:6</a> and <a>22:10</a>; <a>22:11</a> and <a>22:12</a>; <a>22:61</a> and <a>22:62</a>; <a>22:70</a> and <a>22:70</a>). The signatures for each instance in the four minor sets are as follows: <a>22:6</a> (<i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> + <i>bianna</i>) and <a>22:10</a> (<i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> + <i>bim\u0101</i>); <a>22:11</a> (<i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> + <i>huwa</i>) and <a>22:12</a> (<i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> + <i>huwa</i>); <a>22:61</a> (<i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> + <i>bianna</i>) and <a>22:62</a> (<i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> + <i>bianna</i>); <a>22:70</a> (<i>inna</i> <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> + <i>f\u012b</i>) and <a>22:70</a> (<i>inna</i> <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> + <i>\u02bfal\u0101</i>). Now that we have covered the available textual data on <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> at s\u016brah 22 we can summarise what we know: we know the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s to be elliptical statements; we know that they imply <i>something</i>; we know that the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s form an unbroken chain of three flanked by four other <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> statements on either side. We will now consider what this can mean. Firstly, the central position of the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s provides symmetry to the phenomenon of <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s in the s\u016brah. This fact indicates a relationship between the central three <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s and those in each of the two flanks. Secondly, the unbroken consistency which we observe in the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s implies that their value must be <i>uniform</i> (i.e. a single value which applies to all of the three cases). On the basis of the two observations above \u2014 and given the known elliptical nature of the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s \u2014 we conclude that the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s must have a <i>single</i> value; that value must derive from one of the remaining <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s in the s\u016brah; and that value must be <i>unique.</i> Since there are three instances of <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> + <i>bianna</i> in the flanks we can exclude these (<i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> + <i>bianna</i> has its own pan-textual significance and occurs 7 times across the broader text, and is discussed in the note to <a>22:6</a>). While the <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> + <i>bim\u0101</i> signature occurs only once in the s\u016brah, it occurs 6 times across the broader text (it also has its own pan-textual significance, and is discussed in the note to <a>22:10</a>). The <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> + <i>huwa</i> signature occurs twice in the s\u016brah, so we can exclude it. Additionally, it occurs a total of 12 times across the broader text (it also has its own pan-textual significance, and is discussed in the note to <a>22:11</a>). The second of the two <i>inna</i> <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> statements at <a>22:70</a> (<i>inna</i> <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> + <i>\u02bfal\u0101</i>) occurs four times across the broader text (it also has its own pan-textual significance, and is discussed in the note to <a>22:70</a>). This leaves the <i>inna</i> <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> + <i>f\u012b</i> signature at <a>22:70</a>. Not only is it unique within this s\u016brah, it is found nowhere outside of it. Thus, it is a single, unique value, and as such must be the point to which the three \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s point. Before we continue, let us consider more generally: if an important message notes \u2018<i>that</i>\u2019 as a significant item three times but without clear elucidation, where would one look for the value of \u2018<i>that</i>\u2019 <i></i>other than where the text itself tells you: <i>verily, that is[...]</i>? This is precisely the context the unique <i>inna</i> <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> + <i>f\u012b</i> signature at <a>22:70</a> supplies. To continue: we know that the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s anticipate something unsaid explicitly (which is the nature of elliptical statements). And we know also from our broader analysis of the Qur\u2019an that <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> always refers to something prior to the <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> marker (see note to <a>2:2</a>). Since we know that the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s\u2019 elliptical values anticipate the <i>inna</i> <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> + <i>f\u012b</i> signature at <a>22:70</a>, that statement itself must derive its value from what precedes it. The remaining logistical question is: how far back does the <i>inna</i> <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i> + <i>f\u012b</i> signature at <a>22:70</a> refer? It must logically reach back as far as the first hard subject break, and that comes at <a>22:67</a>. Now that we have established both the mechanics and the value for the three \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s, we can now consider the significance of that value. The verse at <a>22:67</a> begins: <i>For every community We appointed a rite for them to perform[...]</i> There is only one possible reference for this, and that is at <a>22:34</a> where that \u2018<i>rite</i>\u2019 is spelled out: <i>that they remember the name of God over what He has provided them of livestock cattle</i>. The reader is expected to understand this association as he applies the value <a>22:67-70</a> at each instance of the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s (<a>22:30</a>, <a>22:32</a>, <a>22:60</a>). Analysed on a thorough pan-textual basis, it is seen that the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s provide intrinsic Qur\u2019anic proof against precisely the type of abuses the Traditionalist attempts upon the Qur\u2019an. Once we have grasped both the mechanism and the value of the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s, it matters little what extraneously derived or imagined rites the Traditionalist would bind upon us; we have the Qur\u2019an\u2019s own word for it: <i>there is only one rite, and it consists in remembering God\u2019s name over livestock as meat</i>. Whether we read <a>22:26-37</a> as a <i>history</i> of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, as a <i>history</i> of Mu\u1e25ammad, or as a convergence of the two matters not; the elliptical <i>dh</i><i>\u0101lika</i>s at <a>22:30</a>, <a>22:32</a> and <a>22:60</a> point the reader three times to the indisputable facts of <a>22:67-70</a>, and those values put paid to all and any later insinuations from no matter what quarter. The facts are clear: firstly, that God appointed <i>one</i> rite for every community (contrary to what the Traditionalist would bind upon his followers) and, secondly, that Mu\u1e25ammad himself knew this and taught accordingly (contrary again to what the Traditionalist would bind upon his followers). Moreover, anyone troubling himself to read the two verses following the elliptical values (i.e. <a>22:71-72</a>) will find a chilling condemnation (and readily recognisable characterisation) of those who historically have been most insistent in forcing their extraneously derived religion upon the believer.

The following context certainly treats of animals (named specifically at <a>22:34</a>), and while the word <i>benefits</i> (Arabic: <i>man\u0101fi\u02bf</i>) found at <a>22:33</a> is not exclusively associated with animals in the broader text, it is clearly associated with them at <a>16:5</a>, <a>23:21-22</a>, <a>36:71-73</a>, <a>40:79-80</a>.

One should remember that the Traditionalist is committed in this segment to gaining maximum purchase upon the Qur\u2019an for his externally derived religion (see also note to <a>2:125</a> and <a>22:30</a>). And here he needs to achieve highly specialised meanings for <i><u>sh</u></i><i>a\u02bf\u0101\u2019ir allah</i> (see notes <a>2:158</a> and <a>22:32</a>) as part of that objective. It is understandable, therefore, in attempting to understand whether his claims are valid, that we should take an interest at this juncture in the phrase \u2018<i>to a stated term</i>\u2019 (Arabic: <i>il\u0101 ajalin musamman</i>) since it applies to the animals for which the Traditionalist claims here an exceptional value. Exceptional claims require exceptional proof. And if he is right in his exceptional claim here of a value of <i>sacrificial animals</i> \u2014 and that the sense is not simply animals in general (see note to <a>22:32</a>) \u2014 then we should expect this accompanying formula to bear that interpretation out. We should begin with what the Traditionalist means by \u2018<i>to a stated term</i>\u2019 here. He means: until a \u2018religiously\u2019 significant, appointed moment in his externally constructed process at which animals brought to his annual pilgrimage are slaughtered. That is his baseline requirement, and anything which confirms this type of sense across the broader text will provide him with genuine support. Analysis of the phrase \u2018<i>to a stated term</i>\u2019 reveals the following facts: 1. it occurs a total of 11 times in the text; 2. it is found in the present s\u016brah twice, more than in any other; 3. it is found nowhere outside of this verse in a context of claimed specialised religious definitions; 4. leaving aside the present context at <a>22:33</a>, in all cases except one it treats of God\u2019s judgment or works: God\u2019s provision; the span God allows (or extends) for men\u2019s life or time of birth; or God\u2019s chosen time of destruction.

Thus, nowhere in the remaining cases of this set can one point to anything which would support the Traditionalist\u2019s case, nothing which treats of any context whatever in which \u2018religious\u2019 ritual is the dominant theme.

On this basis we may reasonably assume that we are to keep this rite. This point is confirmed at <a>22:67</a>. See also note to <a>22:30</a>. Here, for the usual reasons, the Traditionalist frequently attempts to interpolate his required conclusions into the text; Saheeh International, for example, has: <i>And for all religion We have appointed a rite [of sacrifice] that they may mention the name of All\u0101h over what He has provided for them of [sacrificial] animals.</i> This is a deceit on at least three counts.

Between that point and this, despite the Traditionalist\u2019s best efforts to achieve some purchase upon the text for one of the pillars of his religion (the <i>\u1e25ajj</i>), the pickings are so meagre that apart from his usual tactics of claiming highly specialised values for rarely occurring words and inserting words which do not exist in the text, he is able to point to nothing in the words on the page here to support his conclusions.

All other instances of this root in the Qur\u2019an conform absolutely to this principle (<a>9:111</a>, <a>48:10</a>, <a>48:10</a>, <a>48:18</a>, <a>60:12</a>, <a>60:12</a>, <a>60:12</a>; <a>2:282</a>; <a>2:254</a>, <a>2:275</a>, <a>2:275</a>, <a>9:111</a>, <a>14:31</a>, <a>24:37</a>, <a>62:9</a>). The word <i>bay\u02bf</i> (visually identical to <i>biya\u02bf</i> in its non-diacritic form) means <i>sale</i> or <i>trade,</i> for example (cf. especially <a>24:36-38</a>); Lane (p. 285) notes <i>bay\u02bf</i> as <i>the hire</i> or <i>hiring</i> (of land), <i>a thing sold</i> or <i>bought</i>. See further notes to this verse."], ["22:40:6", "6. Arabic: <i>\u1e63alaw\u0101t \u2014</i> plural of <i>\u1e63al\u0101t</i>; i.e. such duties as are incumbent. See note to <a>2:3</a> and <a>Article SZC</a>. Generically, <i>\u1e63al\u0101t</i> denotes duty. In its primary sense it is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at <a>1:1-7</a> of which the statement at <a>1:5</a> forms our part \u2014 commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every man has to acknowledge God\u2019s authority (see <a>7:172</a>).

I remain confirmed in my stated value for <i>\u1e63al\u0101t</i> throughout. See extended note to this verse below."], ["22:40:7", "7. Arabic: <i>masjid</i>, <i>mas\u0101jid</i>. See Notepad VII.i."], ["22:40:8", "8. Sc. <i>would be lost</i>. One should understand the Traditionalist\u2019s problems at this verse, because once we understand those, it becomes clear why he has rendered the verse so bizarrely (with <i>\u1e63alaw\u0101t</i> as <i>Jewish synagogues</i> and the established root for trade and contract as <i>churches</i>). He wishes to achieve an equivalence for his religion with the religions called Christianity and Judaism. We know that <i>mas\u0101jid</i> cannot possibly mean what the Traditionalist claims for it (i.e. specifically \u2014 and exclusively \u2014 \u2018Islamic\u2019 places of worship) but, rather, means <i>places of worship</i> in a general, non-sectarian sense (cf. <a>7:29</a>, <a>17:7</a> and Notepad VII.i); but the Traditionalist has been able to fudge that point in the eyes of the laity. Having done that, the way is clear to attempt to get from <i>monasteries</i> (or <i>pious communities</i>) to his fudged value for <i>mas\u0101jid</i> as <i>mosques</i> in a way which implies equal status for his religion. He attempts to do that by ascribing the values of the buildings characteristic for the main monotheistic religions to the stages in between \u2014 despite the fact that the result is both contrary to the norms of Arabic and to all comparable values in the Qur\u2019an. But the Traditionalist has a second and equally compelling reason to bend this verse into his service: if we allow the normative values for each of the constituent parts, it reads as an endorsement of discrete religious communities, something the Traditionalist has an ideological predisposition against. The religion which is today called Islam is interested in a very different model: that of the <i>Caliphate</i> \u2014 a uniform monolith under a single ruler. This concept is nowhere found in the Qur\u2019an. However, while the object of creating and maintaining a community dedicated to God alone is absolutely central to the message of the Qur\u2019an, men have shown themselves typically more interested in this-worldly conquest than in what the Qur\u2019an has to say. Thus, I am suggesting that a pious community of the type mentioned here at <a>22:40</a> is the unit of Qur\u2019anic advancement, and it is to the end of creating and maintaining such units that imperatives to the believers as a group tend to be directed. I am suggesting also that this reading was inconvenient to interests invested in territorial conquest and conformist, non-thinking \u2018religion\u2019. These, then, are the underlying currents which I believe have worn <i>biya\u02bf</i> into <i>churches</i> (in this one instance only) and <i>\u1e63alaw\u0101t</i> into the surreal value of <i>Jewish</i> <i>synagogues</i> (in this one instance only). The Traditionalist can then point to <i>mas\u0101jid</i> and claim his religious buildings to be comparable with those of Christianity and Judaism (while both defusing any implied imperative to form overtly pious communities, and keeping military action infused with religious purpose). However, if we allow <i>mas\u0101jid</i> its Qur\u2019anic sense of <i>places of worship</i> (see Notepad VII.i), the Traditionalist\u2019s values for <i>\u1e63aw\u0101mi\u02bf</i>, <i>biya\u02bf</i>, and <i>\u1e63alaw\u0101t</i> become superfluous since they are all places of worship. Turning to <i>\u1e63aw\u0101mi\u02bf,</i> we find it is typically rendered <i>monasteries</i>. Lexicons list <i>Christian</i> <i>hermitages</i> and <i>monks\u2019 cells</i>. The underlying root sense appears to be <i>something tapered towards the top</i>, and in Lane (p. 1738), is associated with the eagle (which seeks the highest point to which it can ascend). I think the association with isolated Christian monks\u2019 cells is a later development, and became attached partly due to the word\u2019s vulnerability to later impositions (this is the sole instance of this root in the text), and partly due to the Traditionalist\u2019s ideological requirements of this passage outlined in this note. The values attached to <i>\u1e63aw\u0101mi\u02bf</i> today emphasise seclusion and piety at the expense of community, but that emphasis does not comport with what precedes at <a>22:39-40</a>. Rather, the Qur\u2019anic text suggests organic communities capable of defending themselves, not isolated believers easily expelled. This is the basis on which I justify my value of <i>pious communities</i>. Believing communities have been associated with religions of all stripes since time immemorial. Monasteries or other organised religious communities typically formed the economic and intellectual centres of the broader communities among which they were founded or \u2014 more commonly \u2014 which grew up around them. It is precisely the economic life focused on the \u2018<i>pious communities</i>\u2019 which <i>biya\u02bf</i> naturally references (i.e. <i>trade</i>) since such communities both generated and required material goods; <i>\u1e63alaw\u0101t</i> merely means here what it means throughout (i.e. <i>duties</i>) \u2014 duty being what has characterised life in religious communities across millennia no matter what the denomination or confession (each member typically has a strict set of duties to perform consonant with the order of which he is a member); lastly, the \u2018<i>places of worship wherein the name of God is remembered much</i>\u2019 are merely a central and necessary feature of any such religious community. The reason I believe there to be an elliptical statement at the end of this clause is that the conclusion is inherently tentative. Trade and duties and places of worship wherein the name of God is remembered much <i>may</i> survive the destruction of a pious community, but it is, perhaps, unlikely. It is not a rule set in stone, but a possibility which merits warning. Had God stated this conclusion explicitly, that would connote an immutable principle. Since we are left to infer the consequences, the status of the warning is different."], ["22:41:1", "1.

This verse is problematic for the Traditionalist. It contains <i>al zak\u0101t</i> but cannot in truth be suborned to a single value of <i>paying a percentage tax on wealth</i>, which is his required outcome. His broader presentation relies on his extraneously derived values for this term, and that the imperative formula in which <i>al zak\u0101t</i> is found (<i>\u0101t\u016b</i> <i>al zak\u0101t</i>) typically comes without obvious context, and this makes comparative analysis difficult. Here the formula is different, and this provides us data by which to compare <i>al zak\u0101t</i> as a term. The verb is <i>fa\u02bfla</i> (<i>to do, to act</i>) and comes in combination with the preposition <i>li</i> which, though it has a range of functions, can be understood here to play the same role as the <i>li</i> in the following verse, where it provides stylistic support for the object only. Muhammad Asad translates somewhat freely here: <i>and who are intent on inner purity</i> but notes: <i>Lit., \u201cworking for\u201d or \u201cactive in behalf of [inner] purity\u201d, which is the meaning of zakah in this context (Zamakhshari; the same interpretation has been advanced by Abu Muslim).</i> I agree with Asad\u2019s value for <i>al zak\u0101t</i> here. My point would be that this broader, generic value is the general sense of <i>al zak\u0101t</i> in all cases, and verses <a>23:5-9</a> provide genuine context which both confirms that value and adds detail to it (see <a>Article SZC</a>). Maintenance of the sexual impetus within the bounds stated at <a>23:5-6</a> (more broadly: within heterosexual relations between men and women where the man has concluded a marriage contract with the woman) is a <i>material</i> (as well as spiritual) contribution made by the individual to the society. The man is <i>materially</i> responsible for the woman, and the woman is also in a <i>material</i> commitment to exclude herself from the marketplace of females open to offers of marriage. While there is a number of instances where the Traditionalist\u2019s preferred value for <i>al zak\u0101t</i> jars with the context in which <i>al zak\u0101t</i> is found, there is none in which <i>purity</i> does so. Traditionalist translators at Saheeh International appear to recognise this verse as a pothole in their road, and stumble over it the best they can with: <i>And they who are observant of zak\u0101h</i>, while remaining silent on what that might mean. Meanwhile, Hilali &amp; Khan ride over the Arabic on caterpillar tracks to achieve: <i>And those who pay the Zakat</i>. On a related point, there is a correlation between <a>23:2-9</a> and <a>70:23-34</a> which a reader familiar with the Qur\u2019an will recognise. Minor differences aside, there are three distinguishing features: <a>23:3-4</a> (not found in <a>70:23-34</a>), and <a>70:24-28</a> and <a>70:33</a> (not found in <a>23:2-9</a>). A superficial comparison might lead to the view that verses <a>70:24-25</a> relate to \u2014 or expand upon \u2014 <a>23:4</a>, and then claim support for the Traditionalist\u2019s value for <i>al zak\u0101t</i> on that basis. The facts are these: the \u2018bookends\u2019 are clear in each case (<a>23:2</a> and <a>23:9</a>, and <a>70:23</a> and <a>70:34</a>); whereas there are comparable \u2018variables\u2019 on both sides (<a>23:3-4</a> and <a>70:24-28</a>), there is a single \u2018addition\u2019 at <a>70:33</a> (i.e. with no correlation between <a>23:2-9</a>); lastly, verses <a>70:23-34</a> comprise the greater text. This means that the only question is at what point one \u2018adds\u2019 <a>23:3-4</a> to <a>70:23-34</a> to achieve a \u2018full\u2019 text: before <a>70:24-28</a> or after it. If one \u2018adds\u2019 <a>23:3-4</a> after <a>70:24-28</a>, the argument that <a>70:24-25</a> relate to \u2014 or expand upon \u2014 <a>23:4</a> is null.

This provides the Qur\u2019anic dress code for women (see also the imperative to lengthen the dress found at <a>33:59</a>). The present clause is an ideological battleground in the war to prove a requirement for women to wear what is today called <i>\u1e25ij\u0101b</i> in the Qur\u2019an. The word here is <i><u>kh</u></i><i>umur</i> (sg. <i><u>kh</u></i><i>im\u0101r</i>), and the term has acquired so much baggage that the best I can say of it is that it means <i>coverings</i> (certainly, that is the sense of related verb which means <i>to cover, hide, conceal</i>). People from culturally \u2018Islamic\u2019 countries often get emotional because in those cultures <i><u>kh</u></i><i>im\u0101r</i> does in fact denote a head-covering. To say that this is what the Qur\u2019an means by the term is another matter. Again, with the word <i>juy\u016bb</i> (here: <i>bosoms</i>), the understanding will depend to a large extent on the required outcome. For example, dyed-in-the-wool Traditionalists Hilali &amp; Khan have here: <i>and to draw their veils all over Juyubihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms, etc.).</i> This is a cultural and ideological position, and should be understood as such. Since this is a disproportionately important issue for many people, so I will summarise my own thoughts on it in the following manner: <i>Is it true that the Qur\u2019an requires a head-covering for all believing women?</i> No, it is not. <i>Does the Qur\u2019an require believing women to dress modestly?</i> Yes, it does. <i>Do societies exist in which a head-covering is a requirement of modesty?</i> Yes, there do. <i>Does traditional \u2018Islamic\u2019 dress (i.e. long dress and headscarf) encompass the Qur\u2019anic requirement for believing women?</i> Yes, it does. <i>Is the traditional \u2018Islamic\u2019 dress the same thing as the Qur\u2019anic requirement?</i> No, it is not. Now, while I know the claim that traditional \u2018Islamic\u2019 dress is a Qur\u2019anic imperative to be false, I must add the following point: women are told to dress so that they will be recognised as believers and not harassed (<a>33:59</a>). A headscarf and the other modesty requirements found in traditional \u2018Islamic\u2019 dress together meet this criterion for historical reasons (i.e. such women are, by dint of custom, known to be women of faith). However, traditional Jewish and Christian (Orthodox) women\u2019s dress meets these requirements also. Distinct from these observations, it is my opinion that women who choose to dress modestly are providing a great service to themselves, their families, and their societies; I also hold it to be a crime before God to ascribe to the Qur\u2019an imperatives which the Qur\u2019an does not contain. The problem in today\u2019s media-driven society, of course, is that the association with faith which the headscarf once had has given way to other associations: those of intellectual and cultural backwardness and unthinking adherence to violent ideologies.

Abdullah Yusuf Ali makes a delightful comment here which I reproduce in full: <i>The first three points in the Parable centre round the symbols of the Niche, the Lamp, and the Glass. (1) The Niche (Mishkah) is the little shallow recess in the wall of an Eastern house, fairly high from the ground, in which a light (before the days of electricity) was usually placed. Its height enabled it to diffuse the light in the room and minimised the shadows. The background of the wall and the sides of the niche helped throw the light well into the room, and if the wall was white-washed, it also acted as a reflector: the opening in front made the way for the light. So with the spiritual Light: it is placed high above worldly things: it has a niche or habitation of its own, in Revelation and other Signs of God; its access to men is by a special Way, open to all, yet closed to those who refuse its rays. (2) The Lamp is the core of the spiritual Truth, which is the real illumination; the Niche is nothing without it; the Niche is actually made for it. (3) The Glass is the transparent medium through which the Light passes. On the one hand, it protects the light from moths and other forms of low life (lower motives in man) and from gusts of wind (passions), and on the other, it transmits the light through a medium which is made up of and akin to the grosser substances of the earth (such as sand, soda, potash, etc.), so arranged as to admit the subtle to the gross by its transparency. So the spiritual Truth has to be filtered through human language or human intelligence to make it intelligible to mankind.</i>"], ["24:36:1", "1.

It reproves them as transgressors, much in the same way as it reproves transgressors of a number of types (political, economic, and so forth). There is no question but that male homosexual acts are wrong within the purview of the Qur\u2019an. However, one should remember that those who practice sodomy are under no compulsion to be believers themselves (cf. <a>2:256</a>). Logically, should a particular man be a believer but find himself afflicted with drives he chooses to regard as too powerful to control, should he wish to renounce his faith in favour of sodomy, that is nobody\u2019s business but his own so long as he does not impact the believing society with his sin. The Qur\u2019an safeguards people\u2019s privacy in their homes against prying persons (<a>24:27</a>, <a>24:61</a>), a right a sodomite should enjoy as much as anyone else. Within the Qur\u2019anic jurisprudence binding upon believers, then, male-on-male penetrative sex is <i>sexual immorality</i>, fundamentally wrong, and taboo. It logically falls under the same legislation and punitive requirements as sexual intercourse outside marriage of any other type (marriage being recognised only between one male and up to four females). However, the Qur\u2019anic mood is not one of instant and total condemnation; comparable contexts suggest that wrong action should be discouraged and reproved by friends and \u2018let be\u2019 if people repent and reform (cf. <a>4:16-17</a>), and there can be punishment only when specific circumstances are met (cf. <a>24:2</a>). Additionally, one should remember that Ibr\u0101h\u012bm entreated God on behalf of the city of L\u016b\u1e6d (<a>11:74</a>), and L\u016b\u1e6d himself reproved his people before he left and they were punished.

One of the functions of the Qur\u2019an is to correct calumnies levelled against the prophets in the corrupted texts of previous peoples. Chapter 19 of Genesis has it that Lot (L\u016b\u1e6d) committed incest with his daughters after leaving the city \u2014 to ensure (as one is given to understand) the continuance of the family line due to a dearth of males in the new location; the daughters\u2019 argument rings hollow given that the males of the city they had fled could not have provided issue in any case (a point alluded to at <a>11:78-79</a>). More convincing, perhaps, would be an argument for the need to raise up further children to Lot (L\u016b\u1e6d) on the grounds that his wife was now dead, but such an argument is closed down by the Qur\u2019an which states explicitly his wife was an <i>\u2018old woman</i>.\u2019 Thus, the Talmudic-sounding \u2018justification\u2019 found at Genesis 19 for incest is refuted on whatever basis it might be advanced: L\u016b\u1e6d\u2019s wife had been past child-bearing age, thus it made no difference from the point of view of procreation that she was now dead; and the men of the city of L\u016b\u1e6d were not potential husbands for his daughters, thus the dearth of eligible men in the scenario following that of the destruction of the city of L\u016b\u1e6d was \u2014 in this regard at least \u2014 no different to that which preceded it.

The first category we have looked at; as concerns the second category, <i>min</i> features frequently as part of the adverbial phrase <i>min \u1e25ay</i><i>th</i><i>u.</i> This adverbial convention occurs at <a>2:149</a>, <a>2:150</a>, <a>2:191</a>, <a>2:199</a>, <a>2:222</a>, <a>7:19</a>, <a>7:27</a>, <a>7:182</a>, <a>12:68</a>, <a>16:26</a>, <a>16:45</a>, <a>39:25</a>, <a>59:2</a>, <a>65:3</a>, <a>65:6</a>, <a>68:44</a>. Comparison of all instances reveals it to have the two main functions: 1. <i>from wherever, from whence, whence</i> (e.g. <a>2:149</a>, <a>2:150</a>, <a>2:191</a>), 2. <i>in what manner</i>; <i>in accordance with how; in what manner it be that</i> (e.g. <a>2:222</a>, <a>12:68</a>, <a>65:5</a>). All instances appear in the notes and reference <a>2:149</a>. Read thus, the line here means: <i>I killed a soul (just) like them</i> (i.e. in the manner that they kill souls). We turn now to consider which of these options is the most likely. Reading beyond the clause under consideration, we encounter M\u016bs\u0101\u2019s concern that Fir\u02bfawn\u2019s people will kill him. Thus, <i>killing</i> is the dominant thread within the verse, and \u2018<i>like them</i>\u2019 is the option in closest keeping with that thread. Additionally, the Qur\u2019an states three times that Fir\u02bfawn <i></i>killed the <i>males</i> among the children of Israel (<a>2:49</a>, <a>7:141</a>, <a>14:6</a>); thus by killing a male among the children of Israel M\u016bs\u0101 committed an act which was precisely \u2018<i>like them</i>\u2019. On that basis, my view is that \u2018<i>like them</i>\u2019 is a likely reading; but in terms of strict grammar (since the word here is <i>min</i> and not <i>min \u1e25ay</i><i>th</i><i>u</i>, the case is strong also for the possessive, namely: <i>I killed a soul of theirs</i> (i.e. belonging to them, and which they legally possessed). However, I have rendered in the translation using the common convention of <i>among them</i>, a formulation which itself is ambiguous as discussed above, and I confine further thoughts to the notes.

Hence, I prefer to base my rendering on the interpretation advanced and convincingly argued by Tabari, who regards the crucial particle ma not as a negation but as a relative pronoun synonymous with alladhi (\u201cthat which\u201d or \u201cwhatever\u201d), and understands the noun khirah in its primary significance of \u201cthat which is chosen\u201d or \u201cpreferred\u201d, i.e., because it is considered to be the best: in another word, as a synonym of khayr. Zamakhshari refers to this interpretation with evident approval (without, however, mentioning Tabari specifically), and enlarges upon it thus: \u201cGod chooses for mankind whatever is best (ma huwa khayr) and most beneficial (aslah) for them, for He knows better than they themselves do what is good for them.\u201d</i>"], ["28:68:2", "10:18:2"], ["28:68:3", "2:105:3"], ["28:70:1", "2:255:1"], ["28:70:2", "2.

The Traditionalist insists upon a fanciful, highly specialised interpretation here. In summary, his assertion (see also <a>58:1-4</a>) is that pre-Islamic Arabs would divorce their wives by saying that a wife was \u2018like the back of\u2019 his mother, and that it is this practice which the verb at this juncture (rendered by me as <i>assist</i>) references. No support is found for this assertion in the text itself, we are expected simply to take the Traditionalist\u2019s word for it. Facts first: the form III verb based on <i>\u1e93ahara</i> objectively and correctly means <i>to assist</i>, <i>to help</i>, <i>to aid</i>, <i>to support</i> \u2014 and the Traditionalist himself renders this form III verb in just this sense in all other instances outside of this specific context and its adjunct at <a>58:1-4</a> (see <a>9:4</a>, <a>33:26</a>, <a>60:9</a>). Allowing the verb its natural meaning (i.e. that of <i>assisting among your wives</i>) fits the context exactly. The Qur\u2019anic redress for those who swear off their wives (which is what the Traditionalist is claiming as the sense here though by another name) is entirely different and comprehensively treated at <a>2:226</a>. Now to the application of reason: in a context which permits of limited polygeny a situation is possible in which one wife might not be able to have children while others might be able to have them. In such a case, a man \u2014 it may be reasoned \u2014 might decide (it is assumed within the Qur\u2019anic principle of mutual consultation) to \u2018<i>assist</i>\u2019 both the fertile and infertile wives by allowing the infertile wife to raise a child born to the fertile wife. Thus, the infertile wife might experience something of the joys of motherhood, and the fertile wife \u2014 who may already have her hands full with existing children \u2014 might get support in the raising of a child. (Other comparable scenarios are where the husband has a child from a previous wife, or a wife brings an existing child into a marriage.) The point in such scenarios (i.e. in which a man <i>\u2018assists\u2019</i> among his wives) is that we should remember who the true mother is and not obfuscate that fact. These points granted, it is possible to envisage a case in which a man has allowed a wife to raise a child of which she is not the natural mother, and that that decision has resulted either in regret on the part of the natural mother or in a change of mind on the part of the man. It is surely such a case which is the subject here, i.e. one in which a man has to go back on this arrangement (returning a child to the care of its natural mother, thus depriving the adoptive mother of her charge).

The Traditionalist would have us make three assumptions: firstly, that the actions of Mu\u1e25ammad the man constitute those of \u2018<i>the Messenger</i>\u2019; secondly, that the mass of stories ascribed to Mu\u1e25ammad by Persian scribes centuries after his life constitute a reliable historical record of Mu\u1e25ammad\u2019s actions; thirdly, that the expression \u2018<i>obey God and His messenger</i>\u2019 indicates a Qur\u2019anic requirement for incorporating this extra-Qur\u2019anic library into the process of understanding what God requires of those believers who accept the Qur\u2019an. Regarding the first point, we should note that a careful reading of the present surrounding context makes clear that whatever is meant in the Qur\u2019an by \u2018<i>God and His messenger</i>\u2019 applied here also to Mu\u1e25ammad (what follows at <a>33:37</a> serves to bring Mu\u1e25ammad himself into compliance with Qur\u2019anic directives since one clearly detects, in the third and fourth clauses of <a>33:37</a>, a reluctance on the part of Mu\u1e25ammad \u2014 one which, in that context, may logically be taken only to indicate unwillingness to act on the Qur\u2019anic judgment that the divorced wife of an adopted son may legally be taken to wife \u2014 a point which is implicit at <a>33:4</a>).

The duty binding upon the believers in the current context begins at <a>33:50</a> (to arrive on time and not to enter the Prophet\u2019s house early). With this comes the injunction to greet with a salutation (that is: loudly and clearly to announce one\u2019s presence before entering his house, and not to enter it without permission) for the purposes of protecting the modesty of the occupants, but also that there be no doubt as to the chastity of a wife (for reasons which in this context include ensuring complete moral transparency and integrity in the houses of the Prophet). The Qur\u2019an does not say we are <i>to greet the Prophet</i> \u2014 though the Traditionalist assumes that it does, and often \u2018translates\u2019 accordingly; it says we are <i>to greet with a salutation</i>. In recognition of the lamentable and undeniable need to overstate the obvious, I would add that the Prophet is now <i>dead</i>. Just as there is today no need to arrive at his house on time, there is also no need to greet either him or his wives. The Traditionalist\u2019s practice of pouring honorifics upon a dead man and \u2018greeting\u2019 him as part of his prayer ritual has no basis in the Qur\u2019an, is a clear case of <i>sh</i><i>irk</i>, and borders on necromancy.

According to the legend alluded to above, Solomon died on his throne, leaning forward on his staff, and for a length of time nobody became aware of his death: with the result that the jinn, who had been constrained to work for him, went on labouring at the heavy tasks assigned to them. Gradually, however, a termite ate away Solomon\u2019s staff, and his body, deprived of support, fell to the ground.

The kingdom of Sheba was largely devastated, and this led to the migration of many southern (Qahtan) tribes towards the north of the Peninsula. Subsequently, it appears, the system of dams and dykes was to some extent repaired, but the country never regained its earlier prosperity; and a few decades before the advent of Islam the great dam collapsed completely and finally.</i> This may reasonably be claimed by the Arabia Felix thesis as a point in its favour (see Notepad XVI)."], ["34:17:1", "1.

One common reading, as given by Abdullah Yusuf Ali, is: <i>But they said, \u201cOur Lord! Place longer distances between our journey-stages[...]</i>. His comment, reproduced in full is: <i>The people of Saba were given every chance. They had prosperity, skill, trade and commerce, and a healthy and beautiful country. They also had, apparently, great virtues, and as long as they remained true to their virtues, i.e., to the law of God, they remained happy and contented. But when they became covetous and selfish, and became jealous of other people\u2019s prosperity instead of rejoicing in it, they fell from grace and declined. It may be that the climate changed, the rainfall became scantier, perhaps on account of the cutting down of hill forests: trade routes changed, on account of the people falling off in the virtues that make men popular: behind all the physical causes was the root-cause, that they began to worship mammon, self, greed, or materialism. They fell into the snare of Satan. They gradually passed out of history, and became only a name in a story. Moral: it is only God\u2019s Mercy that can give true happiness or prosperity, and happiness or prosperity is only a snare unless used for the highest service of God and man</i>. As mentioned, incline towards the reasoning and reading of Muhammad Asad whose comment at this point I also reproduce in full: <i>In its generally-accepted spelling - based on the reading adopted by most of the early scholars of Medina and Kufah - the above phrase reads in the vocative rabbana and the imperative ba</i>\u2019<i>id (\u201cOur Sustainer! Make long the distances ...\u201d, etc.), which, however, cannot be convincingly explained. On the other hand, Tabari, Baghawi and Zamakhshari mention, on the authority of some of the earliest Qur</i>\u2019<i>an-commentators, another legitimate reading of the relevant words, namely, rabbuna (in the nominative) and ba</i>\u2019<i>ada (in the indicative), which gives the meaning adopted by me: \u201cLong has our Sustainer made the distances ...\u201d, etc. To my mind, this reading is much more appropriate since (as pointed out by Zamakhshari) it expresses the belated regrets and the sorrow of the people of Sheba at the devastation of their country, the exodus of large groups of the population, and the resultant abandonment of many towns and villages on the great caravan routes</i>."], ["34:19:2", "2.

This is a pivotal, crucial clause and absent any methodical approach to textual values has resulted in wild guessing as to its meaning. A. J.

J. Dawood has: <i>Their faction is no more than a beaten army</i>. Saheeh International has: <i>[They are but] soldiers [who will be] defeated there among the companies [of disbelievers].</i> And Abdullah Yusuf Ali has: <i>But there - will be put to flight even a host of confederates</i>. The translators cited understand two things: 1. that there is a host of some kind and 2. that this host is defeated. What their presentations lack is any demonstration of the import of \u2014 and connection between \u2014 these two facts. Part of their problem is that they are trying to work blind: they have no pan-textual method; they do not understand the system of Qur\u2019anic definitions; they do not understand the function of <i>bal</i> in <a>38:8</a> or of the hanging <i>am</i> at <a>38:9-10</a>, and on top of that they are obliged to deal with the sandstorm of the Traditionalist\u2019s extraneous narrative interpolation. Under such circumstances it would be surprising if they were able to demonstrate any clarity. I will unpick the present clause within the framework of the methodology used here before going on to demonstrate what it means. Firstly, <i>jund</i> is a collective noun rendered <i>force</i> throughout (<a>19:75</a>, <a>36:28</a>, <a>36:75</a>, <a>37:173</a>, <a>38:11</a>, <a>44:24</a>, <a>67:20</a>) and indicates a group directed towards an aim of some kind, usually \u2014 though not always \u2014 with a military aspect; secondly, <i>hun\u0101lika</i> means <i>there</i> (<i>at that place</i>) or <i>thereupon</i> and is rendered in this second mode throughout (<a>3:38</a>, <a>7:119</a>, <a>10:30</a>, <a>18:44</a>, <a>25:13</a>, <a>33:11</a>, <a>38:11</a>, <a>40:78</a>, <a>40:85</a>); thirdly, we have the verb <i>hazama</i>. It occurs twice as a verb (<a>2:251</a>, <a>54:45</a>) and once (here) as a passive participle. The first instance of the verb treats of the victory of the children of Israel under \u1e6c\u0101l\u016bt (in which D\u0101w\u016bd slew J\u0101l\u016bt), while the second instance treats of the inevitability of victory over the forces of denial (after a rehearsal of the defeat of Fir\u02bfawn). Hence, both contexts unquestionably treat of <i>defeat</i>, which may safely be relied upon as the value here (in passive mode). Fourthly, the plural noun <i>al a\u1e25z\u0101b</i> is rendered here as <i>the parties</i> throughout. A careful reading of all instances (<a>11:17</a>, <a>13:36</a>, <a>19:37</a>, <a>33:20</a>, <a>33:20</a>, <a>33:22</a>, <a>38:11</a>, <a>38:13</a>, <a>40:30</a>, <a>43:65</a>) makes clear that this term has a particular meaning: it denotes those groups or factions into which men fall based on their reaction to the message given by God. That is: <i>al a\u1e25z\u0101b</i> are those who encounter and (usually) reject the message brought by the Messenger (this point is made explicitly here at <a>38:12-14</a>). We are left with the meaning of <i>m\u0101</i> and <i>min</i>. The latter consistently means <i>among</i> or <i>of</i> and is rendered thus here. The particle <i>m\u0101</i> (which follows <i>junb</i>) has a range of meanings. However, following an indefinite noun (as here) it means <i>some</i>, <i>certain</i> (for example <i>yawman m\u0101</i> \u2014 <i>some day</i>, <i>sometime in the future</i>). On this basis we render: <i>Some force is thereupon defeated among the parties</i>. To understand what this means we need to understand that the tone and content of the lead-up from the beginning of the chapter treats of the confrontation and defeat of the ruling elite of the day. On a verse-by-verse basis: <a>38:1</a> evokes the Qur\u2019an; <a>38:2</a> states that those who ignore warning are lost; <a>38:3</a> reminds of the destruction of previous communities; <a>38:4-5</a> cite amazement at being warned by one of their own, and subsequent accusations against the message-bearer; <a>38:6-7</a> list initial strategies on the part of the ruling elite to refute the message; <a>38:8</a> gives a true assessment of the condition of those warned; <a>38:9-10</a> posit a challenge to two positions which fundamentally underpin the position supported by the ruling elite which is: <i>then</i> <i>let them ascend into the causes! \u2014</i> i.e. let them make the heavens and the earth obey them (if they truly have dominion of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, etc.). However, the fact is that they do not have the treasures of the mercies of God nor do they have the dominion of the heavens and the earth (cf. <a>38:9-10</a>); they have smoke, mirrors and threats. Thus, they and their claims are exposed. The crucial import of <a>38:11</a> lies in the fact that it is at this point (i.e. having taken the argument to this juncture) that <i>some force is thereupon defeated among the parties</i>. Under the aegis of the God Protocol (see my book <i><a>The God Protocol</a></i>) this juncture has legal significance. After this point, those who lead a community are guilty and that community is liable to punishment \u2014 a point made explicitly at <a>38:12-15</a>.

Now from the totality of the Qur\u2019anic teachings, becomes apparent that the innermost purpose of all true faith is, firstly, a realization of the existence of God and of every human being\u2019s responsibility to Him; secondly, man\u2019s attaining to a consciousness of his own dignity as a positive element - a logically necessary element - in God\u2019s plan of creation and, thus, achieving freedom from all manner of superstitions and irrational fears; and, lastly, making man aware that whatever good or evil he does is but done for the benefit, or to the detriment, of his own self (as expressed in verse 15 above).</i>"], ["45:17:2", "10:23:2"], ["45:18:1", "1.

Muhammad Asad supplies interesting additional information here: <i>The first part of the above sentence - i.e., the phrase yatalaqqa al--mutalaqqiyan - may be understood in either of two senses: \u201cthe two that are meant to receive do receive\u201d, or \u201cthe two that aim at meeting each other do meet\u201d. The classical commentators adopt, as a rule, the first sense and, consequently, interpret the passage thus: \u201c...the two angels that are charged with recording man\u2019s doings - do record them, sitting on his right and on his left\u201d. In my opinion, however, the second of the two possible meanings (\u201cthe two that aim at meeting each other\u201d) corresponds better with the preceding verse, which speaks of what man\u2019s innermost self (nafs) - whispers within him\u201d, i.e., voices his subconscious desires. Thus, \u201cthe two that aim at meeting\u201d are, I believe, the two demands of, or, more properly, the two fundamental motive forces within man\u2019s nature: his primal, instinctive urges and desires, both sensual and non-sensual (all of them comprised in the modern psychological term \u201clibido\u201d), on the one side, and his reason, both intuitive and reflective, on the other. The \u201csitting (qa\u2019id) on the right and on the left\u201d is, to my mind, a metaphor for the conflicting nature of these dual forces which strive for predominance within every human being: hence, my rendering of qa\u2019id as \u201ccontending\u201d. This interpretation is, moreover, strongly supported by the reference, in verse 21, to man\u2019s appearing on Judgment Day with \u201cthat which drives and that which bears witness\u201d - a phrase which undoubtedly alludes to man\u2019s instinctive urges as well as his conscious reason.</i>"], ["50:19:1", "2:71:1"], ["50:20:1", "1.

Thus, the current phrase has a fully future application. However, there is a second layer to it. In order to grasp that layer, one needs to understand several things: 1. The use of the verb here in the Qur\u2019an (Arabic: <i>iqtaraba</i>), (see note to <a>21:2</a>). 2. That the latter portion of the Qur\u2019an forms a series of night vigils the purpose of which is to warn those who reject and to fortify those who accept (see Notepad XXI). 3. That Mu\u1e25ammad\u2019s station as a prophet and messenger meant that he was executing the mechanism of warning followed by destruction (when rejected) that runs through the Qur\u2019an (detailed in my work <i><a>The God Protocol</a></i>). 4. That, given point 3, Judgment was itself closing in upon the people to whom the messenger-prophet was preaching. 5. That the statement here \u2018<i>Drawn nigh has the Hour</i>\u2019 echoes the sense of what precedes at <a>53:57</a> \u2014 immediately following which we read that God alone can forestall its advent."], ["54:1:2", "2. Claims are made for this verse by the Traditionalist which I do not accept. While I do not share Asad\u2019s confidence in the \u2018reports\u2019 he mentions to any degree at all, his comments here are worthy of consideration, and will be helpful in equipping the student with a broader perspective: <i>Most of the commentators see in this verse a reference to a phenomenon said to have been witnessed by several of the Prophet\u2019s contemporaries. As described in a number of reports going back to some companions, the moon appeared one night as if split into two distinct parts. While there is no reason to doubt the subjective veracity of these reports, it is possible that what actually happened was an unusual kind of partial lunar eclipse, which produced an equally unusual optical illusion. But whatever the nature of that phenomenon, it is practically certain that the above Qur\u2019an-verse does not refer to it but, rather, to a future event: namely, to what will happen when the Last Hour approaches. (The Qur\u2019an frequently employs the past tense to denote the future, and particularly so in passages which speak of the coming of the Last Hour and of Resurrection Day; this use of the past tense is meant to stress the certainty of the happening to which the verb relates.) Thus, Raghib regards it as fully justifiable to interpret the phrase inshaqqa \u2018l-qamar (\u201cthe moon is split asunder\u201d) as bearing on the cosmic cataclysm - the end of the world as we know it - that will occur before the coming of Resurrection Day (see art. shaqq in the Mufradat). As mentioned by Zamakhshari, this interpretation has the support of some of the earlier commentators; and it is, to my mind, particularly convincing in view of the juxtaposition, in the above Qur\u2019an-verse, of the moon\u2019s \u201csplitting asunder\u201d and the approach of the Last Hour. (In this connection we must bear in mind the fact that none of the Qur\u2019anic allusions to the \u201cnearness\u201d of the Last Hour and the Day of Resurrection is based on the human concept of \u201ctime\u201d.)</i>"], ["54:2:1", "2:211:1"], ["54:2:2", "10:76:2"], ["54:3:1", "5:49:1"], ["54:3:2", "2.

An outstanding symbol of this ability is man\u2019s skill, unique among all animated beings, in making tools; and the primary material for all tool-making - and, indeed, for all human technology - is iron: the one metal which is found abundantly on earth, and which can be utilized for beneficial as well as destructive ends. The \u201cawesome power\u201d (ba\u2019s shadid) inherent in iron manifests itself not merely in the manufacture of weapons of war but also, more subtly, in man\u2019s ever-growing tendency to foster the development of an increasingly complicated technology which places the machine in the foreground of all human existence and which, by its inherent - almost irresistible - dynamism, gradually estranges man from all inner connection with nature. This process of growing mechanization, so evident in our modern life, jeopardizes the very structure of human society and, thus, contributes to a gradual dissolution of all moral and spiritual perceptions epitomised in the concept of \u201cdivine guidance\u201d. It is to warn man of this danger that the Qur\u2019an stresses - symbolically and metonymically - the potential evil (ba\u2019s) of \u201ciron\u201d if it is put to wrong use: in other words, the danger of man\u2019s allowing his technological ingenuity to run wild and thus to overwhelm his spiritual consciousness and, ultimately, to destroy all possibility of individual and social happiness.</i>"], ["57:26:1", "2:79:1"], ["57:26:2", "2:59:2"], ["57:27:1", "3:43:1"], ["57:27:2", "3:37:2"], ["57:27:3", "3:48:3"], ["57:27:4", "20:39:4"], ["57:27:5", "5.

My own view is that the core sense of this verse is that a man\u2019s talents make room for him. I provide below, for interest, two distinct Traditionalist readings. The more adamant Traditionalist tends to see this verse primarily in terms of his religion and Caliphate-building project. Typical of this view are Hilali &amp; Khan, whose rendering of the verse follows: <i>O you who believe! When you are told to make room in the assemblies, (spread out and) make room. Allah will give you (ample) room (from His Mercy). And when you are told to rise up [for prayers, Jihad (holy fighting in Allah\u2019s Cause), or for any other good deed], rise up. Allah will exalt in degree those of you who believe, and those who have been granted knowledge. And Allah is Well-Acquainted with what you do.</i> Traditionalist convert Muhammad Asad takes a less vociferous view, and his numbered notes to this verse follow his rendering of the verse itself: <i>O YOU who have attained to faith! When you are told, \u201cMake room for one another in your collective life\u201d,1 do make room: [and in return,] God will make room for you [in His grace].2 And whenever you are told, \u201cRise up [for a good deed]\u201d, do rise up;3 [and] God will exalt by [many] degrees those of you who have attained to faith and, [above all,] such as have been vouchsafed [true] knowledge:4 for God is fully aware of all that you do. 1. Lit., \u201cin the assemblies (al-majalis)\u201d. Although it is frequently assumed that this refers to the assemblies held by the Prophet, when his followers would throng around him in their eagerness the better to hear what he had to say, or - more generally - to congregations in mosques, etc., in later times, I am (with Razi) of the opinion that the plural noun majalis is used here in a tropical or metaphorical sense, denoting the totality of men\u2019s social life. Taken in this sense, the \u201cmaking room for one another\u201d implies the mutual providing of opportunities for a decent life to all - and especially to the needy or handicapped - members of the community. 2. Commenting on this passage, Razi says: \u201cThis verse indicates that if one widens the means (abwab) of happiness and well-being of God\u2019s creatures (\u2018ibad), God will widen for him all that is good in this life and in the hereafter. Hence, no reasonable person (al-\u2019aqil) could ever restrict [the purport of] this \u2018verse to merely making room for one another in an [actual) assembly.\u201d 3. The interpretation implied in the words \u201cfor a good deed\u201d interpolated by me above is analogous to that offered by most of the classical commentators, and most explicitly by Tabari; in the words of Qatadah (ibid.), \u201cWhenever you are called upon to do a good deed, respond to this call.\u201d 4. Cf. the saying of the Prophet: \u201cThe superiority of a learned man (\u2018alim) over a [mere] worshipper (\u2018abid) is like the superiority of the moon on the night when it is full over all other stars\u201d (Ibn Hanbal, Abu Da\u2019ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa\u2019i, Ibn Majah and Darimi).</i>"], ["58:12:1", "2:9:1"], ["58:12:2", "2.

The context at <a>59:7</a> treats of the allocation of material things exclusively \u2014 at the time the Messenger was alive. To ascribe to it any other value is, frankly, deceit. The way the Traditionalist quotes this small part of one verse out of context is analogous to claiming that the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) says <i>there is no God</i>. Of course, it does indeed say that (at Psalms <a>14:1</a>, for example). However, the whole verse reads: <i>The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.</i> The Qur\u2019an warns against those who twist the words of God (<a>5:41</a>). The Traditionalist\u2019s problem here (aside from his requirement to find Qur\u2019anic authority for his religion where there is none) is that he has not understood the concept of implicit punctuation. Verse <a>59:8</a> begins with <i>For the poor \u00e9migr\u00e9s[...].</i> The Traditionalist translator is forced to insert words of his own composition here such as <i>It is[...]</i>. However, when we understand that there is no oversight or deficiency in the text, but rather that the mechanics of the syntax implicitly force us to break the narrative into blocks on the basis of our own intelligence (and that this mechanism is itself a safeguard against the very type of abuse under discussion) then we begin to appreciate the beauty and wisdom of this mechanism, and to regard it as an ally."], ["59:7:4", "2:203:4"], ["59:8:1", "1.

While I do not follow him in my rendering, the reader should know what the Traditionalist claims in this regard. Muhammad Asad summarises the point as well as anybody: <i>This prediction is supported by several references in the Gospel of St. John to the Parakletos (usually rendered as \u201cComforter\u201d) who was to come after Jesus. This designation is almost certainly a corruption of Periklytos (\u201cthe Much-Praised\u201d), an exact Greek translation of the Aramaic term or name Mawhamana. (It is to be borne in mind that Aramaic was the language used in Palestine at the time of, and for some centuries after, Jesus, and was thus undoubtedly the language in which the original - now lost - texts of the Gospels were composed.) In view of the phonetic closeness of Periklytos and Parakletos it is easy to understand how the translator - or, more probably, a later scribe - confused these two expressions. It is significant that both the Aramaic Mawhamana and the Greek Periklytos have the same meaning as the two names of the Last Prophet, Muhammad and Ahmad, both of which are derived from the verb hamida (\u201che praised\u201d) and the noun hamd (\u201cpraise\u201d). An even more unequivocal prediction of the advent of the Prophet Muhammad - mentioned by name, in its Arabic form - is said to be forthcoming from the so-called Gospel of St. Barnabas, which, though now regarded as apocryphal, was accepted as authentic and was read in the churches until the year 496 of the Christian era, when it was banned as \u201cheretical\u201d by a decree of Pope Gelasius. However, since the original text of that Gospel is not available (having come down to us only in an Italian translation dating from the late sixteenth century), its authenticity cannot be established with certainty.</i> It is my opinion that the Gospel of St. Barnabas \u2014 which I have read several times \u2014 while interesting, was written within the Islamic period. It contains references and assumptions which identify it as a piece of \u2014 perhaps pious \u2014 Islamic extemporisation rather than an original scripture containing the words and deeds of \u02bf\u012as\u0101.

That this does not (and cannot) imply acceptance of the Traditionalist\u2019s religion is particularly obvious given that the preceding context treats of first M\u016bs\u0101 and then of \u02bf\u012as\u0101, both of whom appealed to their respective people and neither of whom were Muslims in the sense the Traditionalist uses the word. Rather, the term indicates the submission of the will to that of another. This is clear when we compare this clause with <a>47:35</a> where the same collocation (in the active voice) is used in the purely prosaic sense of <i>sue for peace</i> in a war setting. Consider also <a>40:10</a> which treats of the invitation to faith (not to a specific \u2018religion\u2019); and see also <a>68:42-43</a> where the setting is the Day of Judgment.

The fact that the earliest followers of Jesus regarded him as purely human is evident from the many theological controversies which persisted during the first three or four centuries of the Christian era. Thus, some renowned theologians, like Theodotus of Byzantium, who lived towards the end of the second century, and his followers - among them Paul of Samosata, Bishop of Antioch in the year 260 - maintained that the \u201csonship of God\u201d mentioned in the then-existing texts of the Gospels was purely symbolic, denoting no more than that Jesus was a human being exalted by God. The originally widespread teachings of Bishop Arius (280-326) centred in the concept of Jesus as a mortal man chosen by God for a specific task, and in the concept of God as absolutely One, unknowable, and separate from every created being; this doctrine, however, was ultimately condemned by the Councils of Nicaea (325) and Constantinople (381), and gradually ceased to have any influence on the Christian masses.</i> How the \u02bfAs\u012br-\u1e24ej\u0101z and Arabia Felix theses would address this point is beyond the purview of this work.

The Traditionalist tends to include a note here referring to an item of clothing, which he takes to be the object, and which I assume comes from his preferred supplanting literature. Muhammad Asad furnishes a useful comment to <a>21:91</a> which I repeat here also: <i>This allegorical expression, used here with reference to Mary\u2019s conception of Jesus, has been widely - and erroneously - interpreted as relating specifically to his birth. As a matter of fact, the Qur\u2019an uses the same expression in three other places with reference to the creation of man in general - namely in <a>15:29</a> and <a>38:72</a>, \u201cwhen I have formed him... and breathed into him of My spirit\u201d; and in <a>32:9</a>, \u201cand thereupon He forms [lit., \u201cformed\u201d] him fully and breathes lit., \u201cbreathed\u201d] into him of His spirit\u201d. In particular, the passage of which the last-quoted phrase is a part (i.e., <a>32:7-9</a>) makes it abundantly and explicitly clear that God \u201cbreathes of His spirit\u201d into every human being. Commenting on the verse under consideration, Zamakhshari states that \u201cthe breathing of the spirit [of God] into a body signifies the endowing it with life\u201d: an explanation with which Razi concurs. As for the description of Mary as allati ahsanat farjaha; idiomatically denoting \u201cone who guarded her chastity\u201d (lit., \u201cher private parts\u201d), it is to be borne in mind that the term ihsan - lit., \u201c[one\u2019s] being fortified [against any danger or evil]\u201d - has the tropical meaning of \u201cabstinence from what is unlawful or reprehensible\u201d (Taj al-\u2019Arus), and especially from illicit sexual intercourse, and is applied to a man as well as a woman: thus, for instance, the terms muhsan and muhsanah are used elsewhere in the Qur\u2019an to describe, respectively, a man or a woman who is \u201cfortified [by marriage] against unchastity\u201d. Hence, the expression allati ahsanat farjaha, occurring in the above verse as well as in <a>66:12</a> with reference to Mary, is but meant to stress her outstanding chastity and complete abstinence, in thought as well as in deed, from anything unlawful or morally reprehensible: in other words, a rejection of the calumny (referred to in <a>4:156</a> and obliquely alluded to in <a>19:27-28</a>) that the birth of Jesus was the result of an \u201cillicit union\u201d.</i> Cf. <a>3:49</a>, <a>15:29</a>, <a>32:9</a>"], ["66:12:5", "2:285:5"], ["67:3:1", "1.

The word <i>kh</i><i>uluq</i> occurs at just one other place (<a>26:137</a>). There it is found in the mouths of those who disbelieve as something pertaining only to the tradition of former peoples. From this it follows that <i>kh</i><i>uluq</i> denotes an accepted code of practice, a way of doing things pertaining to a wider purview than that of mere personal morality or character \u2014 which is the value the Traditionalist ascribes to <i>kh</i><i>uluq</i> at <a>68:4</a>. The case I am making is more than supported by the use of the preposition <i>\u02bfal\u0101</i> here which, when used without reference to a particular verb (as here), indicates <i>on</i>, or <i>upon</i> and is used often to denote <i>adherence to</i> or <i>standing upon</i> (in the sense of <i>basing one\u2019s assumptions upon</i>).

Many chapters have defining characteristics. Here that characteristic is <i>annahu</i> or <i>that</i> (<i>it</i>), and closely-related constructions. The verse at <a>72:1</a> identifies what was revealed to the Messenger, and other translators tend to render along the lines I have here in terms of the construction mentioned above. Thereafter, translators tend to elide this construction where it reappears. I can understand that because where this feature appears elsewhere in the broader text of the Qur\u2019an it is often redundant in English. So on first blush it makes sense to elide it in the remainder of the s\u016brah also. But it occurs in the present s\u016brah with such frequency that I was compelled to consider this feature as significant in some way. My conclusion is that it appears so repeatedly in the chapter for two reasons. Firstly, the subject matter itself treats of <i>al jinn</i>, whom we understand to be representative of the dominant men who sit atop any society \u2014 including ours \u2014 and rule. In our broader discussion of that topic (see <a>Article SJC</a>), we identify a correlation between the powers wielded by ruling elites and the effective use of esoteric or occult powers by those elites. Thus, this repeated feature emphasises the fact of this s\u016brah\u2019s <i>revelation</i> to the Messenger, effectively linking all sentences which contain the feature with the opening statement: <i>Say thou: it is revealed to me, that[...]</i>. Moreover, the recurrent accent upon the word <i>that</i>, while easily (and, again, correctly) elided in other circumstances, serves here not only to put the reader in mind of this s\u016brah as something <i>revealed</i> to Mu\u1e25ammad, but juxtaposes that fact with the words of <i>al jinn</i> who describe historical attempts to force access to the heavenly realms to obtain information, and that such attempts are now all but futile. Thus, this format itself makes plain that the revelation given to Mu\u1e25ammad is superior to whatever the schemes of <i>al jinn</i> might be. Secondly, this same mechanism sets in place an emphasis on the revealed nature of verse <a>72:19</a> \u2014 which falls outside that segment which comprises the words of <i>al jinn</i> \u2014 effectively pulling it back into a focus with the same emphasis on <i>revelation</i> as the statements of <i>al jinn</i>. Finally, the same mechanism serves a different but related function at <a>72:27</a>.

The construction has a partitive emphasis: it is \u2018<i>a band of the domini</i>\u2019 (i.e. some portion of the total number of domini), not all members of that group. This nuance will be of increasing interest as we progress through the present s\u016brah."], ["72:1:4", "18:50:4"], ["72:1:5", "15:1:5"], ["72:2:1", "2:3:1"], ["72:2:2", "3:95:2"], ["72:3:1", "1.

Like me, Muhammad Asad does not accept uncritically the view that <i>al jinn</i> are non-human entities \u2014 at least, he does not do so at this point. Asad, himself a Jew (born Leopold Weiss), supplies a comment which I include for interest: <i>If we accept the supposition that the beings spoken of here were Jewish strangers, the \u201coutrageous things\u201d (shatat) which they mention would appear to be an allusion to the deep-set belief of the Jews that they were \u201cGod\u2019s chosen people\u201d - a belief which the Qur\u2019an consistently rejects, and of which the new converts now divested themselves.</i> The reference could also be to the foolish in general \u2014 for example, by analogy with the construction <i>most moderate of them</i> (i.e. <i>among them</i>) at <a>68:28</a> \u2014 or to the creators of lies about God, such as the inventors of the Talmud, or Saul of Tarsus. However, my view is that since it is <i>al jinn</i> who are speaking \u2014 whom I identify as representative of the dominant men or ruling elites of the time \u2014 I think it most likely that they are referring to one of their own on that basis. Accordingly, I think the reference most likely to indicate Emperor Constantine who, it will be remembered, convened and presided over the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE. The result of this Council, at least according to Wikipedia as of January 2021, was that: <i>The Council declared that the Son was true God, coeternal with the Father and begotten from His same substance, arguing that such a doctrine best codified the Scriptural presentation of the Son as well as traditional Christian belief about him handed down from the Apostles. This belief was expressed by the bishops in the Creed of Nicaea, which would form the basis of what has since been known as the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed.</i> Emperor Constantine undoubtedly meets our criteria for <i>al jinn</i>, and so while the speakers in the s\u016brah seem most likely to have been Jews, as per Muhammad Asad\u2019s comment, their defining characteristic within the Qur\u2019anic framework is not here Jewishness, but membership of a ruling caste. And on that basis, the speakers would regard Emperor Constantine as one of their own. This understanding comports both with my view of <i>al jinn</i> as representatives of a dominant minority (the Jewish aspect of which is identified by Asad), and with the refutation of common Christian errors at <a>72:3</a>.

The issue of how to understand the word <i>min</i> (Arabic: \u0645\u0650\u0646) in this context is a thorny one. The fact is that <i>min</i> forms a standard part of the construction in which the verb which precedes it here occurs, and does so in combination with its complement particle (Arabic: <i>bi</i> / \u0628\u0650). Thus, a construction familiar to most Muslims is: <i>I seek protection with</i> (Arabic: <i>bi</i> / \u0628\u0650) <i>God from</i> (Arabic: <i>min</i> / \u0645\u0650\u0646) \u2014 i.e. against \u2014 <i>the accursed Satan</i>. We find this construction unambiguously used at <a>19:18</a>, <a>23:97</a>, <a>40:27</a>, <a>113:1-2</a>, <a>114:1-4</a>. The remaining instances of the form I of this verb (<a>2:67</a>, <a>11:47</a>, <a>23:98</a>, <a>44:20</a>) use <i>lest</i> or <i>that</i> (Arabic: <i>an</i> / \u0627\u0646), and we can disregard those here. The question is whether one is to regard <a>72:6</a> as divergent from those structures with identical components at <a>19:18</a>, <a>23:97</a>, <a>40:27</a>, <a>113:1-2</a>, <a>114:1-4</a>, and if so, on what basis. I will present in my own wording the two possible alignments, then give other translators\u2019 renderings with my comments, before presenting my conclusions. If we are to read the first clause of the present verse in alignment with its fellows in <i>min</i>, then we must understand it as: <i>Men among the servi sought protection with men against the domini</i>. Here the import is that men among the servi sought protection with others like themselves <i>against the domini</i>. This reading, using my own terminology, is consistent with all other instances which employ the same grammatical components. However, the divergent reading (i.e. one which, though possible to Arabic is anomalous to <a>19:18</a>, <a>23:97</a>, <a>40:27</a>, <a>113:1-2</a>, <a>114:1-4</a>) is: <i>Men among the servi sought protection with men among the domini</i>. Here the import is that men of one kind sought refuge with men of another kind and the complement is left unfulfilled. We will now consider some translators. Here we are interested in the constructions used, not translators\u2019 understanding of key terminology. A. J. Arberry has: <i>But there were certain men of mankind who would take refuge with certain men of the jinn</i>; Hilali &amp; Khan, keen to avoid textual evidence pointing to humans in the second case, have: \u2018<i>And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the masculine among the jinns</i>; Asad has: <i>Yet [it has always happened] that certain kinds of humans would seek refuge with certain kinds of [such] invisible forces</i>; lastly, Saheeh International has: <i>And there were men from mankind who sought refuge in men from the jinn</i>. We see that the first three translators favour what I am calling the divergent reading, while Saheeh International fudges the issue by using the ambiguous <i>from</i>, which can mean both <i>from among</i> and <i>against</i>. The problem, in my view, is less one of grammar than one of exegesis. The Traditionalist does not possess an understanding of each of the types of human and non-human entities discussed in <a>Article SJC</a> which is consistent in all places in the Qur\u2019an (he derives it from extraneous sources), so it is natural that he struggles in his exegesis here. We have been able to present a textually consistent identification of the key types, and that has assisted us in presenting an exegesis of the verses of this s\u016brah to this point, one which comports both with that identification and with the text on the page. The question is whether we can continue in that vein here while applying Occam\u2019s razor, i.e. the principle that the option requiring the smallest number of assumptions is probably the correct one. In our case, provided our exegesis is not unduly disrupted, it requires less assumptions \u2014 given that <a>72:6</a> contains the same grammatical components as <a>19:18</a>, <a>23:97</a>, <a>40:27</a>, <a>113:1-2</a>, <a>114:1-4</a> \u2014 to accept that <a>72:6</a> comports with its fellows and that the meaning of the troublesome <i>min</i> in this verse is what it is in all other comparable cases: <i>from</i> in the sense of <i>against</i>. This results in a full verse in: <i>Men among the servi sought protection with men against the domini, so they increased them in baseness.</i> Understood thus, we find a ready fit in the Servile Wars, three periods of slave uprisings in Rome (135\u2212132 BC, 104\u2212100 BC, 73\u221271 BC) which were brutally put down by the Romans, resulting in the wholesale crucifixion, torture, and death by other horrific means of the rebellious slave armies. While I cannot prove definitively that this is the reference, it fits both with the identifications I have provided and with historical reality, and aligns easily with a reading of the grammatical components found in the verse which is consistent across all comparable instances. In order to avoid an ambiguity of the type found in the Saheeh International translation I have rendered <i>min</i> in this case <i>against</i>."], ["72:6:5", "6:112:5"], ["72:6:6", "6.

We need to address the question of what the verb <i>ba\u02bfa<u>th</u>a</i> means here. It is used in two main senses in the Qur\u2019an: <i>to raise up</i> (i.e. a messenger or prophet) and <i>to raise up</i> (i.e. after death). Among the translators I frequently review, the Traditionalists Hilali &amp; Khan, Saheeh International, and Muhammad Asad all render after the first view, whereas the non-Traditionalist N. J. Dawood renders after the second with: <i>that God could never resurrect the dead</i>; non-Traditionalist A. J. Arberry is ambiguous: <i>that God would never raise up anyone</i>. I can only assume that the first three translators were primed to incline to their view by the usual sources, whereas the non-Traditionalists remained relatively ignorant of those sources and simply followed the Arabic on the page to the best of their abilities. The Qur\u2019an contains 52 instances of the form I of this verb (<a>2:56</a>, <a>2:129</a>, <a>2:213</a>, <a>2:246</a>, <a>2:247</a>, <a>2:259</a>, <a>3:164</a>, <a>4:35</a>, <a>5:12</a>, <a>5:31</a>, <a>6:36</a>, <a>6:60</a>, <a>6:65</a>, <a>7:14</a>, <a>7:103</a>, <a>7:167</a>, <a>10:74</a>, <a>10:75</a>, <a>15:36</a>, <a>16:21</a>, <a>16:36</a>, <a>16:38</a>, <a>16:84</a>, <a>16:89</a>, <a>17:5</a>, <a>17:15</a>, <a>17:79</a>, <a>17:94</a>, <a>18:12</a>, <a>18:19</a>, <a>18:19</a>, <a>19:15</a>, <a>19:33</a>, <a>22:7</a>, <a>23:16</a>, <a>23:100</a>, <a>25:41</a>, <a>25:51</a>, <a>26:36</a>, <a>26:87</a>, <a>27:65</a>, <a>28:59</a>, <a>36:52</a>, <a>37:144</a>, <a>38:79</a>, <a>40:34</a>, <a>58:6</a>, <a>58:18</a>, <a>62:2</a>, <a>64:7</a>, <a>64:7</a>, <a>72:7</a>), and both usages are frequent among them. We need a concrete criterion by which to align the present case with one of these two meanings. We find that the construction here at <a>72:7</a> of an active verb in the negative (Arabic: <i>lan</i> / \u0644\u064e\u0646) is found at one other place only (<a>40:34</a>). There the text expressly mentions \u2018<i>a messenger</i>\u2019. On that basis, we can concur with the Traditionalist reading: the import here is of raising up a messenger. This leaves us with the question of the broader meaning. Muhammad Asad notes here: <i>Thus Tabari (on the authority of Al-Kalbi) and Ibn Kathir [states that] the overwhelming majority of the Jews were convinced that no prophet would be raised after those who were explicitly mentioned in the Old Testament: hence their rejection of Jesus and, of course, Muhammad, and their \u201creaching out towards heaven\u201d (see next verse) in order to obtain a direct insight into God\u2019s plan of creation.</i> While I agree in general terms with Asad here, there exists a broader aspect to the present case. I would agree more readily and fully with him if the text read \u2018<i>we thought</i>\u2019 rather than \u2018<i>you thought</i>\u2019 in this verse. There are, of course, cases in the Qur\u2019an where <i>you</i> is used where <i>we</i> is clearly the import (dialogue among the companions of the cave at <a>18:19</a> comes readily to mind), but in addition to the fact that <i>we</i> and <i>us</i> are routinely and consistently used by the speakers in this segment of this s\u016brah outside the present instance (see <a>72:1</a>, <a>72:2</a>, <a>72:3</a>, <a>72:4</a>, <a>72:5</a>, <a>72:8</a>, <a>72:9</a>, <a>72:10</a>, <a>72:11</a>, <a>72:12</a>, <a>72:13</a>, <a>72:14</a>) we must not disregard the fact that the speakers here are identified in both segments which treat most expansively of <i>al jinn</i> in the Qur\u2019an (<a>72:1-14</a> and <a>46:29-31</a>) as some portion of a greater number (see <a>72:1</a>, <a>46:29</a>). Thus, I am of the view that the change in personal pronoun here at <a>72:7</a> to <i>you</i> indicates a shift in addressee beyond that of the core group of speakers \u2014 or one which at the least embraces a group broader than the core group indicated by the peppering of first-person plural pronouns. On that basis, I believe that the speakers here are addressing, or at least indicating, the full complement of <i>al jinn</i>, perhaps including the speaking Jewish element also, but extending beyond it to include the non-Jewish elements. When we consider the remaining segment in which we can derive details for <i>al jinn</i> (<a>46:29-31</a>) we find that \u2018<i>they turned back to their people, warning</i>\u2019 (<a>46:29</a>), and that a speaker among them twice uses the warning phrase which is so central to our work in <i><a>The God Protocol</a></i>, namely, <i>O our people</i>. Thus, given the available Qur\u2019anic evidence, the case seems strongest that the shift to <i>you</i> at <a>72:7</a> implies a cut to the scene where the speakers appeal to their own people at <a>46:30-31</a> and, in my view, verses <a>72:8-15</a> continue in the same vein. Supposing this is correct, who are their people? Other Jews? I think not. At the level of the apex of temporal power, certainly in our own day, racial and other affiliations mean little. And in any case, a call to one\u2019s own people presupposes a connection of the basis of the stated defining characteristic, and the stated defining characteristic in either of the contexts listed is not Jewishness, but temporal dominance. Thus, given a group of Jewish dominant rulers as the subject of this part of the s\u016brah, an appeal to their people \u2014 especially given my reading of <a>72:4-6</a> \u2014 presupposes other dominant rulers, not other Jews. Supposing we are right, what does this mean? It means that here <i>al jinn</i> \u2014 either including the Jewish element or without it \u2014 was of the view that God would never raise up a messenger. And if our understanding of the Roman component in verses <a>72:4-6</a> is correct, this produces a tension with the (false) prophet and would-be freer of slaves from tyranny Eunus (see notes to said verses above). The implication here, of course, is that those addressed are wrong in their assumption: God <i>was</i> to raise up someone."], ["72:8:1", "72:3:1"], ["72:8:2", "2. In my analysis, <a>72:8-15</a> treats of the appeal of <i>al jinn</i> to their own people (see note to <a>72:7</a> above). Mu\u1e25ammad Asad (whose own process of investigation was not much dissimilar to mine on this point) feels that in the first instance this refers to the Jewish people, but also humanity at large and: <i>[...]may be understood as alluding not only, metaphorically, to the arrogant Jewish belief in their being \u201cGod\u2019s chosen people\u201d, but also, more factually, to their old inclination to, and practice of, astrology as a means to foretell the future. Apart from this - and in a more general sense - their \u201creaching out towards heaven\u201d may be a metaphorical description of a state of mind which causes man to regard himself as \u201cself-sufficient\u201d and to delude himself into thinking that he is bound to achieve mastery over his own fate.</i> My own view is that the reference is to the broader ruling elite \u2014 both Jewish and non-Jewish \u2014 and references their application of dark arts by which occult means they fortify their power and advance their agenda (see <a>Article SJC</a>)."], ["72:8:3", "3.

This provides also a reasonable answer to what is referenced by the number nineteen here (which itself has served as the catalyst for so much generative and speculative output of a mathematical nature beginning with Rashad Khalifa), namely: all other cases of <i>a\u1e63\u1e25\u0101b al n\u0101r</i>.

A careful reading indicates that the force of <i>their number</i> extends to the additional categories of person which follow. Unlike the Khalifa interpretation (which considers that <i>their</i> relates a number of <i>angels</i> in the previous verse and proceeds to make much hay on that basis), my attention is on the broader narrative, and my instinct is to corroborate or reject values on that basis. In recognition of the distinction made here between <i>a\u1e63\u1e25\u0101b al n\u0101r</i> in all nineteen other cases and the one at hand \u2014 and given that other verses clearly reference angels in similar scenarios \u2014 I render this collocation here <i>Guardians of the Fire</i> which general line is taken by most other translators here."], ["74:31:3", "3.

Given what follows, the second of these two options is the one convincing to me. We each have a number of days to live, the core point of which is that we should decide for or against <i></i>God.

It is, of course, impossible to describe the innumerable variations of those answers; nevertheless, a few main lines of thought are clearly discernible, and their mention may be useful for a better understanding of the Qur\u2019anic treatment of this problem. Some people - probably a minority - seem to be convinced that bodily death amounts to total and irreversible extinction, and that, therefore, all talk about a hereafter but an outcome of wishful thinking. Others are of the opinion that after individual death the human \u201clife-essence\u201d returns to the supposed source of its origin - conceived as the \u201cuniversal soul\u201d - and merges with it entirely. Some believe in a successive transmigration of the individual soul, at the moment of death, into another body, human or animal, but without a continuation of individual consciousness. Others, again, think that only the soul, and not the entire human \u201cpersonality\u201d, continues to live after death - that is, in a purely spiritual, disembodied form. And, lastly, some believe in an undiminished survival of the individual personality and consciousness, and regard death and resurrection as the twin stages of a positive act of re-creation of the entire human personality, in whatever form this may necessarily involve: and this is the Qur\u2019anic view of the life to come.</i>"], ["78:4:1", "19:79:1"], ["78:5:1", "19:79:1"], ["78:6:1", "1.

While I am temperamentally inclined to agree with him on this point, in the event I cannot. The reading I have followed (which is the commonest one \u2014 from which Asad explains his divergence), is not only in full agreement with the best lexicons (which, of course, do not take precedence over the Qur\u2019an\u2019s own definitions, nor are to be trusted blindly) but is also confirmed by my full analysis of this point (see Notepad XIX). I would add that while the Qur\u2019an directs itself principally to men as head of tribes and families, while women and men have different essential functions, they are of equal value and their efforts are equally rewarded \u2014 a point which the Qur\u2019an makes clearly. That being the case, when dealing with such metaphorical and highly symbolic parts of the text as this, one naturally extrapolates equivalent pleasures and rewards for women. I make this point not because I am infected with the current social viruses called political correctness and feminism, but because it is objectively the case. As a translator and interpreter and believer, I bear a responsibility for the words as they appear on the page, and it is with cognisance of that responsibility that I have both rendered as I have in this instance and felt moved to include the relevant part of Muhammad Asad\u2019s comment for the edification and broader perspective of the interested reader: <i>[...]it is to be remembered that the term ka\u2019b - from which the participle ka\u2019ib is derived - has many meanings, and that one of these meanings is \u201cprominence\u201d, \u201ceminence\u201d or \u201cglory\u201d (Lisan al-Arab); thus, the verb ka\u2019ba, when applied to a person, signifies \u201che made [another person] prominent\u201d, \u201cglorious\u201d or \u201csplendid\u201d (ibid.) Based on this tropical meaning of both the verb ka\u2019ba and the noun ka\u2019b, the participle ka\u2019ib has often been used, in popular parlance, to denote \u201ca girl whose breasts are becoming prominent\u201d or \u201care budding\u201d hence, many commentators see in it an allusion to some sort of youthful \u201cfemale companions\u2019 who would entertain the (presumably male) inmates of paradise. But quite apart from the fact that all Quranic allegories of the joys of paradise invariably apply to men and women alike, this interpretation of kawa\u2019ib overlooks the purely derivative origin of the above popular usage - which is based on the tropical connotation of \u201cprominence\u201d inherent in the noun ka\u2019b - and substitutes for this obvious tropism the literal meaning of something that is physically prominent: and this, in my opinion, is utterly unjustified. If we bear in mind that the Quranic descriptions of the blessings of paradise are always allegorical, we realize that in the above context the term kawa\u2019ib can have no other meaning than \u201cglorious [or \u201csplendid\u201d] beings\u201d, without any definition of sex; and that, in combination with the term atrab, it denotes, \u201csplendid companions well matched\u201d - thus alluding to the relations of the blest with one another, and stressing the absolute mutual compatibility and equal dignity of all of them[...].</i>"], ["78:35:1", "1.

The fact is that <i><u>gh</u></i><i>arq</i> occurs also at <a>10:90</a> and objectively means there <i>drowning</i>, and the form IV verb <i>a</i><i><u>gh</u></i><i>raqa</i> consistently means <i>to drown</i> (verb: <a>2:50</a>, <a>7:64</a>, <a>7:136</a>, <a>8:54</a>, <a>10:73</a>, <a>17:69</a>, <a>17:103</a>, <a>18:71</a>, <a>21:77</a>, <a>25:37</a>, <a>26:66</a>, <a>26:120</a>, <a>29:40</a>, <a>36:43</a>, <a>37:82</a>, <a>43:55</a>, <a>71:25</a>; passive participle: <a>11:37</a>, <a>11:43</a>, <a>23:27</a>, <a>44:24</a>). Clearly, drowning is a violent event, but to elide the core sense entirely is to deprive the reader of what is plain in the Arabic, so I have rendered literally and supplied additional information in the notes. Muhammad Asad\u2019s thoughts here are characteristically mystical and scholarly, and are supplied for interest: <i>The early commentators differ widely in their explanations of verses 1-5 of this surah. The most popular interpretation is based on the view that the descriptive participles an-nazi\u2019at, an-nashitat, as-sabihat, as-sabiqat and al-mudabbirat refer to angels and their activities with regard to the souls of the dying: an interpretation categorically rejected by Abu Muslim al-Isfahani, who - as mentioned by Razi - points out that the angels are never referred to in the Qur\u2019an in the female gender, as is the case in the above five participles, and that the present passage cannot be an exception. Almost equally unconvincing - because somewhat laboured - are the explanations which link those five participles to the souls of the dying, or to warriors engaged in holy war, or to war-mounts, and so forth. The clearest and simplest interpretation is that advanced by Qatadah (as quoted by Tabari and Baghawi) and Al-Hasan al-Basri (quoted by Baghawi and Razi), who maintain that what is meant in this passage are the stars - including the sun and the moon - and their movements in space: and this interpretation is fully in tune with many other passages in the Qur\u2019an in which the harmony of those celestial bodies in their multiform orbits and graded speeds is cited as an evidence of God\u2019s planning and creativeness. In accordance with this interpretation, the participle an-nazi\u2019at occurring in the first verse denotes the daily \u201cascending\u201d or \u201crising\u201d of the stars, while their subsequent \u201csetting\u201d is indicated by the expression gharqan, which comprises the two concepts of \u201cdrowning\u201d (i.e., disappearing) and, tropically, of the \u201ccompleteness\u201d of this daily phenomenon (Zamakhshari).</i>"], ["79:2:1", "1.

None of these legends needs, of course, to be seriously considered in this context.

In the Qur\u2019anic mode of expression, at-tariq is evidently a metaphor for the heavenly solace which sometimes comes to a human being lost in the deepest darkness of affliction and distress; or for the sudden, intuitive enlightenment which disperses the darkness of uncertainty; or, finally, for divine revelation, which knocks, as it were, at the doors of man\u2019s heart... and thus fulfils the functions of both solace and enlightenment.</i>"], ["86:7:1", "1.

This last clause has ever since given much trouble to the commentators, inasmuch as it is not very plausible that He who has revealed the Qur\u2019an to the Prophet should cause him to forget anything of it. Hence, many unconvincing explanations have been advanced from very early times down to our own days, the least convincing being that last refuge of every perplexed Qur\u2019an-commentator, the \u201cdoctrine of abrogation\u201d. However, the supposed difficulty of interpretation disappears as soon as we allow ourselves to realize that the above passage, though ostensibly addressed to the Prophet, is directed at man in general[...].</i> My own view is that the case is simpler: the classical commentators have not sufficiently embraced the Qur\u2019an\u2019s use of implicit punctuation (i.e. how certain portions of the text cry out that they are asides and should be regarded as parenthetical); thus, this clause relates to the climax of <a>87:2-5</a> above.

The clause in parenthesis at <a>87:6</a> is merely a precursor to the only place in the Qur\u2019an where the Prophet is told personally (i.e. in the second person singular imperative) to recite (Arabic root: <i>q-r-\u2019</i>) \u2014 which occurs in chapter 96. This is another nail in the coffin of the Traditionalist\u2019s stock of fictions which holds that the ninety-sixth chapter was the first revelation Mu\u1e25ammad received.

I.e. the Qur\u2019an. For why we know the Qur\u2019an to be the reference see note to <a>6:92</a>. There is much to unpack in this chapter. The first question here is: <i>what</i> is sent down? The Traditionalist asserts that the pronoun object refers to <i>revelation</i>, his view being confirmed as the correct one (albeit for reasons other than those he typically offers). In treating the Traditionalist\u2019s existing presentation, we must address <a>44:3-4</a> where some see a foreshadowing of, or reference to, what we have here at chapter 97, namely, <i>layla al qadr</i> \u2014 the value of which such people assume to be <i>the night of divine decree</i> in which all affairs are destined for the year ahead, an assumption based entirely on sources other than the Qur\u2019an (for more on which see notes below). Verses <a>44:3-4</a> read: \u201c<i>We sent it down on a blessed night, \u2014 We are warning \u2014 Wherein is separated every wise command</i>\u201d; the context there indisputably treats, at least to some degree, of revelation (see <a>44:2</a>); moreover, we agree with the Traditionalist that it is only reasonable that the same is the case here at chapter 97: that which is referenced by \u2018<i>it</i>\u2019 is, likewise, <i>revelation</i>. However, at chapter 44, the Traditionalist tends to concentrate on the sending down of the revelation to Mu\u1e25ammad as a special, private event focused on the Prophet himself, and he leverages and extends that assumption in order to inform the sense one is to derive under his guidance here at chapter 97 \u2014 and it is this aspect of this topic we now wish to address. To the extent that the revelation of God reaches those men who are not prophets, God \u2018<i>sent it down</i>\u2019 to them also (albeit in a general and more diffused sense \u2014 a sense which the Traditionalist also accepts where it suits him) and it must be this broader, more general sense which is implied in <a>44:3-4</a> since the following context (in fact, the entire chapter) treats of <i>warning</i> \u2014 that is: the emphasis throughout is not on the private receipt of revelation from God by the Prophet, but on the delivery of that revelation to people more generally. If we are to claim a correlation between <a>44:3-4</a> and chapter 97 \u2014 and the Traditionalist does \u2014 on the strength of the similarities in their references to God sending down revelation on a particular night (and I certainly accept that correlation) then we should insist upon equivalence between the two segments: if receipt of revelation (whether heeded or not) by the generality of men (rather than an initial, private receipt by the Prophet) be accepted as operative in the first case, it should be accepted in like manner in the second case also."], ["97:1:2", "2. The etymological options available to the Arabic <i>qadr</i> (often rendered here <i>divine decree</i>) may be gathered into five general groupings, which are separated by semi-colons: <i>extent, scope, quantity, amount, scale, rate, measure, number; sum, amount; degree, grade; worth, standing, value, rank; divine decree</i>. My opinion is that the sense of <i>divine decree</i> is a lexical development originating in another place. Be that as it may, it is certainly the case that such a value for <i>qadr</i> occurs nowhere outside of the present chapter, even according to the Traditionalist\u2019s own assessment. In order to find which of the remaining semantic groupings is referenced here, we should look to all remaining instances of <i>qadr</i> in the text (<a>6:91</a>, <a>22:74</a>, <a>39:67</a>, <a>65:3</a>). We find that at <a>6:91</a>, <a>22:74</a> and <a>39:67</a> <i>qadr</i> means <i>measure</i> in the sense of <i>appraisal</i> or <i>estimation</i> (\u201c<i>and they measured God not with the measure due Him</i>...\u201d). In the sole remaining case outside the present chapter the context is also that of <i>extent</i> or <i>measure</i> (<i>the limits of God</i> at <a>65:1</a>, and [waiting] <i>term</i> at <a>65:2</a>.). Thus in all cases outside the present chapter, <i>measure</i> or <i>extent</i> is either the explicit sense, the dominant context, or both. I must, therefore, assume it to be the sense here also. Since at <a>6:91</a>, <a>22:74</a> and <a>39:67</a> the connotation of <i>measure</i> implied is that of <i>appraisal</i> or <i>determination</i> (in the sense of <i>evaluation</i>), this is the value I identify and use here. The question remains as to who the active agent is in the determination on such a night: God or man. The Traditionalist assumes the former (typically, that God is referenced here, seen as establishing his decree on this special night over all affairs for the coming year). However, this is an assumption, and one for which one can point to no explicit Qur\u2019anic support. The only other place at which the construction <i>night + definite article + noun</i> occurs in the Qur\u2019anic text is at <a>2:187</a> (\u201c<i>On the night of the fast</i>\u201d); the active agents \u2014 i.e. the doers of the noun value \u2014 in that case are men (for it is not God who fasts but men). If we are interested in consistency \u2014 and the Qur\u2019an cites consistency in support of its claim to originate with God \u2014 we should incline to the view that the operation of \u201c<i>al qadr</i>\u201d here pertains, likewise, primarily to men rather than to God (although, naturally, in both cases \u2014 that of <i>determination</i> as here and of <i>fasting</i> as at <a>2:187</a> \u2014 God is the ultimate instigator, witness, and giver of reward). The above points accepted, the import of this collocation here is that God sent down the Qur\u2019an on the night on which men are \u2014 or were \u2014 to make a determination, evaluation or assessment; but a determination, evaluation or assessment of what? The key to this question is grasped by understanding the full sense of the word <i>sal\u0101m</i> as found at <a>97:5</a> (for which see notes thereto) as well as the points covered in the remainder of the notes to this chapter. However, in summary: the believers are to form a determination of the hearers (to decide whether they be friends, believers, rejecters, ignorant ones, etc.) based upon the hearers\u2019 own determination of that portion of the Qur\u2019an recited to them by the believers. Additional contextual and linguistic support for the points found in this note will be gained by reading <a>74:18-25</a>."], ["97:2:1", "1. The formulation here is telling. The convention \u2018<i>And what will convey to thee...?</i>\u2019 always indicates something which Mu\u1e25ammad is not expected to understand, and for which there follows an explanation (<a>69:3</a>, <a>74:27</a>, <a>77:14</a>, <a>82:17</a>, <a>82:18</a>, <a>83:8</a>, <a>83:19</a>, <a>86:2</a>, <a>90:12</a>, <a>97:2</a>, <a>101:3</a>, <a>101:10</a>, <a>104:5</a>). Such is the case here; thus, at <a>97:2</a> the Qur\u2019an presents a Mu\u1e25ammad ignorant of the meaning of <i>layla al qadr</i> \u2014 a point which contrasts starkly with the <i>\u1e25ad\u012bth</i> literature, which ascribes to Mu\u1e25ammad here \u2014 as so often \u2014 knowledge the Qur\u2019an denies him.

Such exegesis supplies superficial but Qur\u2019anically unfounded support to those who are temperamentally inclined to abdicate personal responsibility to do so.

And nor can he \u2014 at least not on the basis of the Qur\u2019an. Certainly the Arabs made pilgrimage to Petra; according to Dan Gibson\u2019s work (<i>Quranic Geography,</i> 2011), no such evidence exists for Mecca until well after the Qur\u2019anic revelation. Today, Petra is a ruin and its interest merely historical; in any case the point is moot (see note to <a>9:28</a> and Notepad XVI). The text does not say <i>serve the lord at this house</i>, it says <i>serve the lord of this house</i>. One can do that anywhere. Whether the Quraysh tribe pre-existed the Qur\u2019anic revelation or was concocted along with the <i>\u1e25ad\u012b</i><i>th</i> <i></i>literature afterwards in order to benefit certain people is a question which requires objective historical investigation. We do know that various groups claimed to be Sabaeans in order to garner privileges under Muslim kings and priesthoods, and that there are countless millions more in the world today who claim direct descent from the Prophet than can genuinely be the case. Such points are of anthropological, social, and political interest but do not have a direct bearing on the chapter in question.

Lastly, <i>bayt</i> \u2014 rendered here <i>house</i> \u2014 also means <i>family</i>.

This form I verb has come to mean <i>to slaughter</i>, <i>to butcher</i> and it is claimed in the sense of <i>to sacrifice</i>, generally speaking, by the Traditionalist in support of one of his favourite pastimes: killing things. I argue that this meaning has attached itself over time. The concept of animal sacrifice is demonstrably alien to the Qur\u2019an as we see \u2018<i>[...]Their flesh does not reach God, nor their blood.

On that basis, it is impossible to consider <i>slaughter</i> or <i>sacrifice</i> the meaning at <a>108:2</a> because the text reads \u2018<i>to thy Lord</i>\u2019 (which is a natural object for both imperatives in the verse \u2014 and the Traditionalist himself typically assumes as much). But God cannot expect one to sacrifice to Him that which He has told us does not reach Him. We must, if we are to be intellectually honest and consistent, look to other accepted meanings for <i>na\u1e25ara</i>. It has two: <i>to master (superlatively)</i> (Lane, p. 2835); and <i>to do something as soon as it becomes due</i> (meanings which both Lane and Badawi-Haleem include).
