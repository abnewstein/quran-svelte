[[1,1,1,"1. Arabic: ra\u1e25m\u0101n \u2014 generally translated most merciful and synonyms thereof which is understandable given modern usage of the word, and the fact that ra\u1e25m\u0101n shares the r-\u1e25-m root with ra\u1e25\u012bm which undoubtedly encompasses such senses. However, there are three arguments against such a Qur\u2019anic value for ra\u1e25m\u0101n. Firstly, there are certain Qur\u2019anic instances where context is at direct odds with the subject of mercy. Secondly, ra\u1e25m\u0101n appears alongside ra\u1e25\u012bm in the bismillah so were the Traditionalist right in his assessment of ra\u1e25m\u0101n, we must admit to a tautologous and therefore superfluous opening statement, which would be odd since the text in general is characterised by exactitude and economy of words. Thirdly, there is historical evidence of usage of ra\u1e25m\u0101n among Nabataean Arabs in the sense of almighty (in a eulogy chiselled in rock describing a king who had just defeated and laid waste his enemies). That ra\u1e25m\u0101n was used in this sense among the Nabataeans lends additional supports to the broader thesis that Mu\u1e25ammad was a Nabataean Arab \u2014 perhaps from Petra, but certainly with access to it as a place of pilgrimage (see Notepad XVI). However, in the present work, ra\u1e25m\u0101n is rendered almighty on the basis of pan-textual analysis (comparison of all instances and their contexts). All instances appear in the notes and reference this verse. See 36:23 and Notepad I.",33],[1,2,1,"1. Arabic: al \u02bf\u0101lam\u012bn. This word denotes the worlds in the broadest of senses, as in: all places that can or do exist, as well as the inhabitants thereof. Most translations use the worlds, but its consistent use across all cases jars in some collocations and contexts. The verses at 26:23-24 definitively confirm the Qur\u2019anic sense of the collocation rabb al \u02bf\u0101lam\u012bn to be the Lord of All Creation (or analogues) and that is the value used for rabb al \u02bf\u0101lam\u012bn here in all cases. Pan-textual analysis of the remaining instances (2:47, 2:122, 3:33, 3:42, etc.) shows al \u02bf\u0101lam\u012bn to reference humankind only, and those instances are rendered all mankind throughout.

Such people are those who either disobey or otherwise reject the truth after it comes to them (see 2:61, 3:112, 4:93, 7:71, 8:16, 16:106, 20:81, 42:16, 48:6, 58:14).",72],[1,7,2,"2.

In the present work, where such letters precede a chapter, they are presented at the top of each page for that chapter both in Arabic and in English transliteration. In Arabic, these letters are known as al \u1e25ur\u016bf al muqa\u1e6d\u1e6da\u02bf\u0101t which means the disjoined\u00a0or the disconnected letters. In English, they tend to be called the mysterious letters, since the default Traditionalist Islamic position is that their meaning may be understood by God alone. Traditionalist Islam has, however, in its 1,400-year history, furnished a number of theories as to their meaning, none of which is convincing, and some of which are highly contrived, insulting to the intelligence, or cases of meandering subjective mysticism. Rashad Khalifa and his principal adherent Edip Yuksel claim an understanding of their meaning on the basis of a broader system of Khalifa\u2019s devising predicated on the number 19. Leaving aside consideration of the relative merits of that system, the fact is that it requires the manipulation of the components of al \u1e25ur\u016bf al muqa\u1e6d\u1e6da\u02bf\u0101t to claim to work at all. In the first (e-book) edition of this work (2016) I stated frankly that I did not know what these letters mean. Having tried and failed to decipher them on more than one occasion, I had made peace with the fact that I would publish my life\u2019s work without an answer to this age-old question. However, as I was approaching the end of the process of correcting the text prior to the first \u2018rough\u2019 hard-copy release, I was privileged to gain the beginnings of a cohesive understanding of their meaning in response to prayer. I included those findings at that stage in my process in that initial hard copy release of my work in 2017. Since that time, I have \u2014 thanks to those individuals who backed me on the basis of that first release of The Qur\u2019an: A Complete Revelation \u2014 been funded through the equally mammoth task of finalising this work prior to what I hope to be its final edition (2021). I am delighted to be able to include within the present edition of my work a full and comprehensive exposition of the meanings of these symbols. Their demonstration is comprehensive, cohesive, and entirely consistent with the text, and \u2014 when understood \u2014 deeply impressive. However, it is not something one can summarise in a few words. The meaning of al \u1e25ur\u016bf al muqa\u1e6d\u1e6da\u02bf\u0101t\u00a0defeated the best minds the Islamic world has produced over the course of fourteen centuries; it is natural that it would require intelligence and concentration to follow their explanation. However, these factors being present, a full understanding of al \u1e25ur\u016bf al muqa\u1e6d\u1e6da\u02bf\u0101t may be gained in a few hours by the diligent student; and once gained, that student\u2019s engagement with \u2014 and appreciation of \u2014 the Qur\u2019an will be greatly enhanced. In the notes below, I furnish the value for each instance of al \u1e25ur\u016bf al muqa\u1e6d\u1e6da\u02bf\u0101t, along with a reference to this note and to Article MLQ where the interested reader may acquaint himself with their comprehensive exposition. alif l\u0101m m\u012bm: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01:1-7 (al f\u0101ti\u1e25ah).",12],[2,2,1,"1. Arabic: dh\u0101lika. This demonstrative pronoun is commonly rendered at this juncture by Traditionalist translators as this (i.e. indicating what follows). The non-sectarian A. J. Arberry distinguishes himself among mainstream translators in that he correctly renders dh\u0101lika that (i.e. indicating what precedes). In the present work the order of the Qur\u2019an is taken to be as fixed and deliberate as that of its contents; thus dh\u0101lika points back at and references that which precedes; namely, the letters alif l\u0101m m\u012bm and \u2014 via them \u2014 al f\u0101ti\u1e25ah (see note below).",4],[2,2,2,"2. Qur\u2019anic definition: al kit\u0101bu l\u0101 rayba f\u012b hi. The Traditionalist has a parsing problem at 2:2. He is not clear whether the sense is: This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah (Saheeh International) or This is the Book; in it is guidance sure, without doubt, to those who fear Allah (Yusuf Ali). He resolves his problem by declaring both readings valid and adding two sets of three dots to the Qur\u2019anic text to indicate alternate readings. The most basic application of pan-textual analysis shows that the same collocation as found at 2:2 is found also at 10:37 and 32:2 where it can only be parsed in the first way; and in accordance with the methodology here, that must be the correct parsing at 2:2 also. To consider 2:2 free of Traditionalist encumbrances then, we should recall that dh\u0101lika indicates what directly precedes (see note above). The question is then: what directly precedes dh\u0101lika here? What directly precedes dh\u0101lika here is the first instance of al \u1e25ur\u016bf al muqa\u1e6d\u1e6da\u02bf\u0101t, which in English transliteration is alif l\u0101m m\u012bm. For the statement here at 2:2 to be meaningful, alif l\u0101m m\u012bm must in some way signify values equal to al f\u0101ti\u1e25ah. And here our journey into understanding al \u1e25ur\u016bf al muqa\u1e6d\u1e6da\u02bf\u0101t begins (for the full analysis of al \u1e25ur\u016bf al muqa\u1e6d\u1e6da\u02bf\u0101t see Article MLQ.) We saw above that verses 1:1-7 comprise a suzerainty (or lord-vassal) treaty defining obligations and rights between parties. Familiarity with the broader text reveals that the Qur\u2019an itself serves two purposes: to confirm what is within its scope, and to give a detailed exposition of al kit\u0101bu l\u0101 rayba f\u012b hi (see 10:37). Thus al f\u0101ti\u1e25ah comprises the quintessence of which the remaining Qur\u2019an is an exposition or working-out. In Arabic kit\u0101b refers to something written. That sense includes contract and synonyms thereof, and given what we have understood of al f\u0101ti\u1e25ah, the collocation under discussion is rendered here and throughout: the Writ about which there is no doubt. See also 10:37, 32:2 and Notepad IX.i.",48],[2,2,3,"3. Qur\u2019anic definition: al muttaq\u016bn. The continuation at 2:3 shows the fuller meaning of al muttaq\u016bn to encompass those who act on the basis of something they have not yet seen. The concept of taqw\u0101 is often translated as consciousness (of God) or piety. I agree with that rendering insofar as it carries the connotation of circumspection and precautionary, preparatory \u2014 or anticipatory \u2014 awareness; yet it is missing two key components: the fact that such fear is warranted (one\u2019s duty is a real and pre-existing obligation; see 7:172), and action based thereon (here: deeds in keeping with one\u2019s obligations, and spending of that which God has provided) which acts comprise evidence of piety. I render the verb to be in prudent fear; the participle those of prudent fear; and the noun prudent fear throughout since this rendering achieves something of the two requirements just stated, as well as the initial sense of fear or consciousness. The possession and exercise of taqw\u0101 is at the core of meaningful human experience (2:21), and something peculiar to humans who, alone in all Creation so far as we know, are capable of conceptual anticipation, and planning and action on the basis thereof. All instances appear in the notes and reference this verse.",86],[2,3,1,"1. See note to 58:4 for Qur\u2019anic usage of to believe in.",20],[2,3,2,"2. Arabic: al \u1e63al\u0101t. As anyone with a background in the religion called Islam will appreciate, al \u1e63al\u0101t figures conspicuously in the Traditionalist\u2019s presentation of the Qur\u2019an, since the value he ascribes to it represents a central plank of the dogma he promotes \u2014 a dogma contrived elsewhere and then ascribed by him to the Qur\u2019an. The Traditionalist\u2019s narrative asserts that the broader collocation here (a frequent motif in the Qur\u2019an) is an imperative to adhere to a formal prayer regime, the number of which and the form of which are together a creative product of the Traditionalist\u2019s preferred, non-Qur\u2019anic sources. Article SZC in the present work summarises the divergent ways that the Traditionalist treats \u1e63al\u0101t; how he is forced, here and there, to replace his preferred value in translations with other (completely unrelated) meanings where it is not possible to impress his required value upon the context since the result would be too bizarre, even for him. He practices this inconstancy with regard to the Qur\u2019an because his value for al \u1e63al\u0101t is a pre-requisite for any analysis he conducts; it is, as we say, an assumed conclusion which is conceived outside of the Qur\u2019an and then imported into it. Since his value for al \u1e63al\u0101t cannot be shown to arise organically in the text, it must be forced to fit in order to achieve his purpose: for his religion to appear intrinsic to the Qur\u2019an. While attentive readers with knowledge of Arabic feel an awkward tension at certain places where the term is found, those who have been thoroughly schooled in the Traditionalist\u2019s assumed conclusions assume he can prove his assertions. I do not make that assumption. On a pan-textual basis \u1e63al\u0101t is shown generically to denote duty. Its core sense is the duty both to serve and to seek help from God alone as per the Writ at 1:1-7 of which the statement at 1:5 comprises our part \u2014 commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every man has to acknowledge God\u2019s authority (see 7:172). But every man has innumerable duties in his various capacities in life. God himself has duties. Of course, \u1e63al\u0101t may also indicate worship since worship is also a duty binding upon a believing man. But just because worship is a duty does not mean that all duty is worship just as, while all oranges are fruits, all fruits are not oranges. This simple point of logic has evaded the Traditionalist and resulted in a shambles, and the Islamic world is that shambles writ large, as countless millions of people are encouraged \u2014 under the auspices of the Traditionalist\u2019s priesthood \u2014 to be lax in the myriad duties which result in honest, productive, God-fearing families and societies, in favour of paying a time tax in (typically) meaningless rituals. The result is the systematic thwarting of potential and frustration of initiative, and finds broader expression in the corruption, ineptitude, intellectual torpidity, wasted lives, and inferior culture which characterise the Muslim world today and led to its collapse. I render \u1e63al\u0101t as duty throughout. Instances of \u1e63al\u0101t and its plural \u1e63alaw\u0101t appear in the notes and reference this verse. See Article SZC.",54],[2,4,1,"1.

There exists an unfortunate disconnect between Arabic and English here. In short, yaqina means two related things: to verify or confirm on the one hand and to be certain or sure on the other \u2014 depending on whether or not the idea is perfective. The two aspects are obviously related: having verified, one is then certain. However, in the English of today such a relationship is not obvious. If to believe is fraught with difficulty in English (meaning today anything between to accept blindly and to be gullible on the one hand through to give purely intellectual assent to on the other) then to be certain to some extent is an expansion or intensification of what to believe has come to mean. But yaqina is an evidence-based conviction; it is not a hope or a feeling \u2014 even an intense hope or feeling. All instances appear in the notes and reference this verse.",129],[2,5,1,"1.

Typically rendered the unbelievers, the rejecters, or the infidels. Verses 2:8-20 focus upon a single term \u2014 al k\u0101fir\u016bn \u2014 and, according to my analysis, define it. To claim al k\u0101fir\u016bn as the unbelievers, the rejecters, or the infidels as per the Traditionalist\u2019s contention may be right in a highly specialised sense, but that sense is now long lost. The Qur\u2019anic definition restores and revives the term fully. Of the terms defined in the first pages of al baqarah it is al k\u0101fir\u016bn which is treated most comprehensively; perhaps because it is precisely this category of person which is most pernicious and destructive. Verses 2:8-20, then, comprehensively fix the correct definition of al k\u0101fir\u016bn which may be summarised (based on the Qur\u2019anic treatment) as follows:\n\nthey claim to believe in God when they are not among those who truly believe\nthey try to deceive both God and those who do believe\nthey are themselves deceived\nthey are diseased in heart\nthey create corruption in the land while failing to see that they do so\nthey have contempt for the faith of the generality of mankind\nthey claim to believe and side with those who believe in God but, in fact, side with the shay\u1e6d\u0101ns; (that shay\u1e6d\u0101n treats of an adversary (against the command of God). see Article SJC\nthey are in possession of guidance yet reject it in favour of error\nthey are blinded in darkness (due to the failure of the \u2018light\u2019 of their own making)\nthe full power and majesty of true light puts them in fear of death\ntheir continued existence is by the grace of God alone\n\nThe Traditionalist\u2019s value of the unbelievers, the rejecters, or the infidels here, again, is not spectacularly wrong, but it is still wrong \u2014 and sufficiently wrong to matter. What the Traditionalist means by al k\u0101fir\u016bn \u2014 and what he wants the reader to infer \u2014 is one who rejects the religion of Islam. That religion is not native to the Qur\u2019an and God did not oblige men to follow the religion today known as Islam since the Qur\u2019an\u2019s own use of the word isl\u0101m and conceits applied to the term subsequently are irreconcilable. Rather, God obliges men to follow guidance if they receive it (2:38). The entire point about al k\u0101fir\u016bn is that they are possessed of guidance; however, they are distinct from those who ignore warning in that al k\u0101fir\u016bn claim to believe and claim to be guided. One of the Traditionalist\u2019s mistakes regarding this category of men is that he identifies al k\u0101fir\u016bn as an external group of deniers and rejecters. This is incorrect; this category of men is an internal group, an insidious force within. A point consistently missed but revealed by following the Qur\u2019anic definition is that al k\u0101fir\u016bn see themselves as righteous. They speak the language of religion and faith. But they refuse to follow guidance. Something close in English would be self-righteous; however, English is now degraded and this word has lost its primary meaning of one wise in his own conceits over the guidance of God and now means merely opinionated and moralistic, which sense is not equal to what is meant here. In the popular Christianised sense, Pharisees is close to what we are looking for. The word hypocrites also bears consideration, but is not fully correct. Generally, however, a hypocrite is just a toady: he pretends to believe what he does not; but he may or may not consider himself righteous. As defined by the Qur\u2019an, al k\u0101fir\u016bn are a very particular type of hypocrite: people who both reject guidance and consider themselves virtuous. In short: al k\u0101fir\u016bn believe themselves followers of guidance, while actually following something else. All things considered, those who reject guidance while claiming virtue acceptably summarises the core concept; in the present edition I render more tersely as the false claimers of guidance throughout where the word occurs as a discrete unit (taking no object), which is how it is found here. As the reader proceeds, he will see this definition of (al) k\u0101fir\u016bn make resounding sense in contexts where the Traditionalist\u2019s assumed value falls flat.

The core and unifying sense of this word is of something accommodating which is spread out. Qur\u2019anic imagery concerning the surface of the earth consistently references a flat expanse. This conception stands in direct contradiction to popular philosophies which contend that the waters of the oceans are convex and held against the surface of a sphere by dint of a theoretical force nowhere demonstrated by empirical experiment. Water has never been shown to lie at rest in any position other than flat.

While the underlying verb does have in addition to the plain sense of to build the connotation of to raise, it implies something hard and made out of something solid. The noun bin\u0101\u2019 is the Arabic for masonry also. The word canopy in English has nothing in common with these concrete senses, and its use by translators is dishonest.",61],[2,22,3,"3.

This word indicates eminence or degree or step or exalted rank. Moreover, such degrees or steps exist only within an integrated system. However, the word s\u016brah has become synonymous with Qur\u2019anic chapter by dint of usage, and is typically used today in that sense exclusively. I do not believe that to be the primary sense. My understanding, based on the totality of instances in the Qur\u2019an (see 2:23, 9:64, 9:86, 9:124, 9:127, 10:38, 11:13, 24:1, 47:20, 47:20), is that the meaning of s\u016brah is akin to order or teaching or political doctrine, and that the challenge the Qur\u2019an makes \u2018to bring a s\u016brah the like thereof\u2019 relates to broad, integrated philosophical systems. Man strives on the basis of his own inclinations to create social and political systems \u2014 from democracy to \u2018Islam\u2019 to communism and libertarianism; the Qur\u2019an\u2019s claim is that anything created by men will be inferior to that which God sent down. I leave the word untranslated throughout. All instances appear in the notes and reference this verse.1. Arabic: alam tara. See note to 2:243.",89],[2,23,2,"2.

I am forced to render min d\u016bni variously across the text by dint of what the English language will allow. However, in all cases the sense is that of exclusivity.

This is one of the many places where the Traditionalist\u2019s preferred values for al k\u0101fir\u016bn (such as the unbelievers or infidels) make no sense. It is also interesting to note that Rabbinic Judaism has it that M\u016bs\u0101 received both the Torah and \u2014 to put it in Qur\u2019anic parlance \u2014 \u2018the like thereof\u2019 (what Rabbinic Jews call the oral Torah \u2014 on which basis, at least in part, they ignore what they have of the Torah). In the case of the Qur\u2019anic revelation, it is the Traditionalist who \u2014 while claiming to follow the Qur\u2019an \u2014 most conspicuously follows something entirely different, something which he takes to be \u2018the like thereof\u2019, citing grounds which are themselves at odds with the Qur\u2019an. By virtue of the fact that he has indeed attempted \u2014 and failed \u2014 to produce \u2018a s\u016brah the like thereof\u2019, the Traditionalist invites comparisons with those described at 2:23-24.",152],[2,25,1,"1.

Muhammad Asad\u2019s comment on this point is interesting: [...]Various interpretations, some of them of an esoteric and highly speculative nature, have been given to this passage. For the manner in which I have translated it, I am indebted to Muhammad \u2019Abduh (in Manar I,232 f.), who interprets the phrase, \u201cIt is this that in days of yore was granted to us as our sustenance\u201d as meaning: \u201cIt is this that we have been promised during our life on earth as a requital for faith and righteous deeds.\u201d In other words, man\u2019s actions and attitudes in this world will be mirrored in their \u201cfruits\u201d, or consequences, in the life to come - as has been expressed elsewhere in the Qur\u2019an in the verses, \u201cAnd he who shall have done an atom\u2019s weight of good, shall behold it; and he who shall have done an atom\u2019s weight of evil, shall behold it\u201d (99:7-8).

Claimed by the Traditionalist as the imperative to pay an obligatory alms tax, all details pursuant to which are \u2014 by his own admission \u2014 not in the Qur\u2019an, but which are presented by him as one of the principal tenets of the religion he promotes. Leaving aside the fact that the concept of an obligatory alms tax is nonsensical (since taxes are taken under compulsion whereas alms are given freely), one is expected to accept the Traditionalist\u2019s claim that al zak\u0101t means a set tax on believers, and mentally ascribe that sense to the word where it occurs in a book in which not only is that assertion nowhere confirmed, there is no case in which the context unambiguously indicates such a meaning. Moreover, where the recipient of the Qur\u2019an is asked about what one should give, no amount is fixed, and the clear implication is that giving is voluntary (2:215, 2:219). Certainly, the Qur\u2019an exhorts believers to give charity (called \u1e63a\u1e0daqah in the text), and to give of everything that God has provided, but such giving is voluntary. It is true that the Qur\u2019an treats of amounts to be given in the case of war spoils. It also states that there is a due to be given on crops, but it neither fixes any amount nor employs al zak\u0101t in that context (6:141). If one had never read any of the non-Qur\u2019anic literature that has attached itself to the Qur\u2019an subsequent to its revelation, it is impossible that one would arrive at the notion of a fixed-percentage annual payment on existing wealth for al zak\u0101t, or that one could reach the precise value for it that the Traditionalist ascribes to it. Article SZC shows that the imperative \u0101t\u016b al zak\u0101t is a generic term which comprises a number of forms of obligations, none of which coincides with the Traditionalist\u2019s assertions.

To be clear: from the Qur\u2019anic evidence, God did not prefer the children of Israel \u2018above all mankind\u2019 for all time \u2014 although there will be those who will cite this verse outside of the broader context in support of that claim. The summaries which follow recount very specific times and ways in which God favoured the children of Israel, and how \u2014 as a rule \u2014 they spurned that favour.

There the convention is not bayna yad- as here but min bayni yad-. In these cases the meaning is physical or temporal and means before. I include part of Muhammad Asad\u2019s comment regarding this expression for interest: Most of the commentators are of the opinion that ma bayna yadayhi - lit., \u201cthat which is between its hands\u201d - denotes[...] \u201cthe revelations which came before it\u201d, i.e., before the Qur\u2019an. This interpretation is not, however, entirely convincing. Although there is not the least doubt that[...] the pronominal ma refers to earlier revelations, and particularly the Bible (as is evident from the parallel use of the above expression in other Qur\u2019anic passages), the idiomatic phrase ma bayna yadayhi does not, in itself, mean \u201cthat which came before it\u201d - i.e., in time - but, rather[...] \u201cthat which lies open before it\u201d. [...]Now this, taken together (a) with the fact - frequently stressed in the Qur\u2019an and since established by objective scholarship - that in the course of the millennia the Bible has been subjected to considerable and often arbitrary alteration, and (b) with the fact that many of the laws enunciated in the Qur\u2019an differ from the laws of the Bible, brings us forcibly to the conclusion that the \u201cconfirmation\u201d of the latter by the Qur\u2019an can refer only to the basic truths still discernible in the Bible, and not to its time-bound legislation or to its present text - in other words, a confirmation of whatever was extant of its basic teachings at the time of the revelation of the Qur\u2019an: and it is this that the phrase ma bayna yadayhi expresses in this context as well as in 5:46 and 5:48 or in 61:6 (where it refers to Jesus\u2019 confirming the truth of \u201cwhatever there still remained [i.e., in his lifetime] of the Torah\u201d).",50],[2,66,2,"2.

Strike it [the neck of a heifer] in some of them [cases of a killed soul]. Many interpretations of this verse exist, some highly subjective and fanciful. On the basis of my own investigations this statement connects most convincingly with Deut. 21:1-9 wherein is found the Mosaic law in a case of unresolved murder. The procedure given there is for the elders of the town nearest the location of the discovered corpse to strike off the head of a heifer at the site, state what facts are known \u2014 namely that they are not guilty \u2014 and wash their hands. The mention of the use of reason at the end of 2:73 corresponds both to the use thereof by the elders at Deut. 21:1-9 and to the fact that God gives \u2018life to the dead\u2019 and \u2018demonstrates his proofs\u2019 to us thereby; just as cases of murder may be established and resolved by the application of evidence and reason, so the fact of our own death and life thereafter is established by the same means. While I do not accept Muhammad Asad\u2019s view of this verse \u2014 and while I reject any reliance on \u1e25ad\u012bth out of hand \u2014 he contributes an intelligent point and makes it well, and I include it for the broader perspective of the interested student: The phrase idribuhu bi-ba\u2019diha can be literally translated as \u201cstrike him [or \u201cit\u201d] with something of her [or \u201cit\u201d]\u201d - and this possibility has given rise to the fanciful assertion by many commentators that the children of Israel were commanded to strike the corpse of the murdered man with some of the flesh of the sacrificed cow, whereupon he was miraculously restored to life and pointed out his murderer! Neither the Qur\u2019an, nor any saying of the Prophet, nor even the Bible offers the slightest warrant for this highly imaginative explanation, which must, therefore, be rejected - quite apart from the fact that the pronoun hu in idribuhu has a masculine gender, while the noun nafs (here translated as \u201chuman being\u201d) is feminine in gender: from which it follows that the imperative idribuhu cannot possibly refer to nafs. On the other hand, the verb daraba (lit., \u201che struck\u201d) is very often used in a figurative or metonymic sense, as, for instance, in the expression daraba fi\u2019l-ard (\u201che journeyed on earth\u201d), or daraba \u2019sh-shay\u2019 bi\u2019sh-shay\u2019 (\u201che mixed one thing with another thing\u201d), or daraba mathal (\u201che coined a similitude\u201d or \u201cpropounded a parable\u201d or \u201cgave an illustration\u201d), or \u2019ala darb wahid (\u201csimilarly applied\u201d or \u201cin the same manner\u201d), or duribat \u2019alayhim adh-dhillah (\u201chumiliation was imposed on them\u201d or \u201capplied to them\u201d), and so forth. Taking all this into account, I am of the opinion that the imperative idribuhu occurring in the above Qur\u2019anic passage must be translated as \u201capply it\u201d or \u201cthis\u201d (referring, in this context, to the principle of communal responsibility). As for the feminine pronoun ha in ba\u2019diha (\u201csome of it\u201d), it must necessarily relate to the nearest preceding feminine noun - that is, to the nafs that has been murdered, or the act of murder itself about which (fiha) the community disagreed. Thus, the phrase idribuhu bi-ba\u2019diha may be suitably rendered as \u201capply this [principle] to some of those [cases of unresolved murder]\u201d: for it is obvious that the principle of communal responsibility for murder by a person or persons unknown can be applied only to some and not to all such cases.",41],[2,73,2,"2.

This statement indicates some among the genuine children of Israel in the first instance, but by extension applies to later Jews, Christians and Muslims also. Those we call Jews invented other sources \u2014 some of them vile in the extreme \u2014 which they attribute to God, and compromised the integrity of the scriptures to which they lay claim centuries ago. Their creed today finds its orientation in the justification of a narrow (historically questionable) racial-supremacy cult, and hypocrisy and moral double standard \u2014\u00a0often no standard \u2014 made virtue. The Christians today have a patchwork religion comprised of some genuine words of \u02bf\u012as\u0101 interwoven with the cosmology of Roman sun-worshipping pagans, the later theology of the originator of their religion (St. Paul), and (frequently) a form of demonic spirit-possession (often, I believe, actuated by means of the so-called Sinner\u2019s Prayer \u2014 a concept found nowhere in the Christian Bible) and one frequently mistaken by the recipient for the Holy Spirit. The Muslims have preserved their book at least. However, Muslim organisations are controlled at the top by the same people who control other religions, and what the laity follows in fact is writings no less garbled or corrupt than those of the Christians and the present-day Jews.

See Notepad XVI and Notepad XVIII and Notepad XV.",95],[2,87,4,"4. Arabic: far\u012bq. We can know that the two types of \u2018faction\u2019 mentioned here do not reference messengers on two counts. Firstly, the Qur\u2019an refers routinely to segments among the recipients of former scriptures in terms of faction (see 2:75, 2:85, 2:100, 2:101, 2:146, 3:23, 3:78, 3:100, 5:70, 33:26). Thus, wherever the word faction is used in their regard, it means a segment of their own population. In the case of both 2:87 and 5:70 the formulation is very specific: the reference in both cases directly prior to that of faction is of \u2018a messenger\u2019 \u2014 i.e. in the singular. Thus, in these two cases also faction must refer to the portions of the population which followed an individual messenger. Where killing of a plurality of men sent to such people is mentioned (see 2:61, 2:91, 3:21, 3:112, 3:181, 4:155) the word used in all cases is prophets (Arabic: anbiy\u0101\u2019). The office of prophet and that of messenger are distinct in the Qur\u2019an, although combined on occasion in a single man. It is recommended that one carefully consider and compare the wording of 4:155 (\u2018prophets\u2019) and 4:157 (\u2018Messenger\u2019). Cf. 58:21 and note thereto. I am indebted to Said Mirza for this point.",281],[2,88,1,"1. Arabic: bal. This particle defies uniform rendering into English by virtue of the range of functions it performs. Lane (p. 3039) has an excellent entry where he describes bal as primarily a particle of digression[...] it denotes emendation wherever it occurs in the case of negation or of affirmation. His comments go into some depth and explore the functions this particle performs in various contexts, and I refer the interested reader to those. I have been guided by Lane in terms of his analysis but not his usage in all cases. He was writing for a different time, and English has evolved since. However, by following Lane\u2019s explanation of the particle\u2019s function we can present a vehicle in the modern language for it. The primary function of bal is to interrupt narrative by means of negation or confirmation and then to digress (i.e. clarify along a new tack). The problem many translators have is that they use nay \u2014 which performs only some portion of the total requirement. By clinging to it they put themselves in a position where they are trying, as it were, to play tennis with no forehand and from the baseline only. What is required is a set phrase which does what Lane states, namely: denotes emendation wherever it occurs in the case of negation or of affirmation. The use of nay manages only the case of negation, and not always very well. What is needed is something equal to: be that as it may, the fact of the matter is[...]. Such a phrase performs the offices which Lane describes and can function equally in cases of negation or affirmation. The shortest route I know of in modern English to achieve this value is: the truth is,[...] which means 1. without doubt; certainly and 2. in reality. This, then, is the default and commonest rendering of bal here. However, there exist also, as Lane explains, several discrete applications of this particle. I evaluate and render these on a case-by-case basis in the light of Lane\u2019s broader comments as: nay, yet, but, or rather depending on the case.

We tend to think of sorcery as something which defies the laws of so-called Nature; something fantastical, unnatural, and unhinged (often in a dark way) from what is real. While I do not wish to reject these connotations across the board, it is of note that sorcery features prominently among the accusations levelled against messengers by those who reject revelation (see examples at 10:2, 11:7, 28:48, 37:15, 38:4, 43:30, 46:7). While the import in those cases may be thought of as something closer to delusional or irrational in modern English, we should bear in mind the following: M\u016bs\u0101 and H\u0101r\u016bn are accused of sorcery by Fir\u02bfawn \u2014 whose very rule is characterised by sorcery. For Fir\u02bfawn \u2014 and those tyrants for whom Fir\u02bfawn is the archetype \u2014 sorcery is the means by which power is maintained. And for such men, sorcery is the collective term for the manipulation of the masses via the dark arts. In our day, those arts result in myths created and installed in the mind of the population via education, media, entertainment, controlled science, controlled religion, and are supported by other means such as planned debt, ignorance, solipsism and sickness, as well as the wholesale drugging of society. Together, these deliver the levers of control into the hands of the dark state. When Fir\u02bfawn accuses M\u016bs\u0101 and H\u0101r\u016bn of sorcery, he is interpreting what he sees as a power-play by them against his regime via the prism of his understanding and experience of the mechanics of power, and naturally sees them as a threat to that power. Thus, he regards them as usurpers who wish to supplant his sorcery with their own. He fails to understand that while his methods are based on deception, trickery, and manipulation, M\u016bs\u0101 and H\u0101r\u016bn are bringing real proofs from God (see 10:77).",144],[2,102,7,"7.

This word has a range of dictionary definitions: trial; temptation; charm, seduction; sedition. Where a word has developed a range of senses, invariably those senses have emerged from a single core concept. The Traditionalist translator tends simply to pick whatever best suits the purposes of trying to create a connection between his religion and the contents of the Qur\u2019an. Such an approach is unsatisfactory and, frankly, dishonest. Our task should be to uncover what the Qur\u2019an means by the term and then to apply it consistently. With this in mind, at 2:102 we have the first instance in the text of fitnah. The usage indicates an obvious relationship between temptation and trial on the one hand and denial of faith on the other. The broader context of the local narrative confirms this. Earlier in the verse we are told Sulaym\u0101n \u2018[...]denied not; but the satans denied\u2019. At the end of the verse we find that such persons have individually sold their souls with cognisance of the consequences of their actions. The total context thus treats of denial of God (a damnable offence which sends one to Hell). To return to H\u0101r\u016bt and M\u0101r\u016bt: learning from them represents a means of denial (of God). If we accept this as the root sense, it is easy to see that the other senses (testing, trial; temptation; charm, seduction; sedition) relate to this core and \u2014 I infer \u2014 have grown out of it. I render in accordance with the root sense identified here of means of denial in all instances of the noun, and where the transitive verb occurs as to subject to means of denial.

When a man sells his soul he must understand that he bears personal responsibility for the contract; the shay\u1e6d\u0101n needs a man\u2019s permission to proceed \u2014 and that is what is occurring here. The aspirant must himself insist upon being given the knowledge he seeks from the hierophant so that the shay\u1e6d\u0101n can \u2014 as he will \u2014 legitimately disown and condemn him on the Day of Judgment.

The same is true of the primary foundational texts (i.e. \u1e25ad\u012bth) and standard legal process (fiqh) of Traditionalist Islam.

What is meant in the Qur\u2019an is: those entrenched in rejection of God and who are in fundamental and complete denial of the Creator.

This is the response to the condition at 2:108. The point, in summary, being made here is this: 1. Only God guides (cf. 2:107). 2. If you want a high degree of specificity from God (2:108), then know that therein lies a danger of denial of God at the hands of many \u2018doctors of the Law\u2019, who want to return you to unbelief out of envy. The group called in the Arabic ahl kit\u0101b is identified in the present work as any religious ruling class; at the time of the revelation it referred to those religious ruling classes connected with Judaic and Christian theologies only since no analogous group had yet coalesced and appended itself to the Qur\u2019an. Today, the situation is different. The arguments forwarded by those called today Christians and Jews as the segment continues are made also \u2014 albeit in modified form \u2014 by their equivalents among those called Muslims. The point is, surely, that we are to be wary of such people and to rely upon primary revelation and God alone. We are not to war against the doctors of the Law as a class \u2014 we know there are some good men among them; rather, we are to \u2018forgive and forbear\u2019. But I point out that, on the basis of my understanding of the Qur\u2019an as a whole, that this does not mean we are to outsource our responsibility to learn and apply the Qur\u2019an for ourselves to \u2018experts\u2019. Rather, we are to rely on God alone, and to be wary of those who \u2014 experience shows \u2014 frequently arrogate to themselves or to specious sources that authority which belongs to God.

The Traditionalist compounds this initial error with its unavoidable corollary at this point: failure to grasp that the statement here serves as a counterpoint to what immediately precedes, which is that those who truly have \u2018nothing to stand upon\u2019 are those who undermine the places of worship of God (i.e. no matter what denomination they pertain to, or who worships within them). The religion the Traditionalist imposes upon the Qur\u2019an is nowhere mentioned or indicated either here or anywhere else in the text; nor does the Qur\u2019an propose that any religion (in the sense in which a religionist means the term) has a monopoly \u2014 or any superior claim \u2014 on God (a point implicit in the statement at 2:115).

However, having reviewed all instances of li qawmin, the sense across that range is not that there exists a (single) people which bears the characteristics introduced by li qawmin, but rather that there exist people (in a collective sense, certainly, but comprising individuals) for whom what follows is true. Given the absence of an indefinite article in Arabic, a choice has to be made between for a people and for people in English, and something of the Arabic is lost no matter which side of the line one comes down on, but on balance the choice I have made seems the more correct one and I render li qawmin generally throughout as here.

However, that original site \u2014 no matter where it once was \u2014 is now closed to those who hold to the Qur\u2019an (see note to 9:28), so if a place of pilgrimage is what is referenced here, such can only be of historical interest today.

See note to 9:28 and Notepad XVI.",122],[2,125,6,"6. Arabic: mu\u1e63all\u0101. This is the only occurrence of this noun. The Traditionalist applies to this word the value of a place of prayer (and by prayer he means a ritual prayer found nowhere in the Qur\u2019an). I am not prepared to accept this level of specificity in a case with no Qur\u2019anic support. The facts we can support are these: mu\u1e63all\u0101 is a noun of place based on the \u1e63-l-w root, a root which I connect with complete consistency with the concept of duty and generically with the obligation to serve God alone (as per 1:5). The Traditionalist, on the other hand, applies his assumptions to that root selectively to gain the results he needs. In this case, he regards mu\u1e63all\u0101 as a place of prayer at his box in Mecca. To me, the following two points seem reasonable precepts upon which to proceed: firstly, claims to certain, specialised knowledge of what mu\u1e63all\u0101 indicates should, given the absence of concrete data, be treated with caution; secondly, it is irresponsible and intellectually dishonest to promote or accept theology based on the specific interpretation of ambiguous or unproven statements (cf. 3:7). Of course, it may be that mu\u1e63all\u0101 does in fact denote a place in the sanctuary which Ibr\u0101him instituted; if it does, I cannot prove it Qur\u2019anically \u2014 and nor can the Traditionalist. However, even if that still happens to be the case, I do know that the site of that sanctuary is not at Mecca; the evidence points to Petra, and that chapter of history is now closed, and was closed within the lifetime of the Messenger (see note to 9:28 and my book The God Protocol). That taken as given, the imperative at this verse indicates an object which it is both impossible to know with certainty and impossible to implement. Alternatively, if the house in the preceding clause simply means the house a man creates with his family as a monotheistic unit (which is undoubtedly what 2:125-141 treats of), then this is something we can adopt as a reasonable interpretation and apply to our lives. We can indeed aspire to the example of Ibr\u0101him in our marriages; to create families in which monotheism alone is practiced and promoted, even at the expense of our comfort in the broader society. It would be irresponsible to claim this as a central point of doctrine, and I do not do so. But since we know that the Traditionalist\u2019s cult is focused on an invalid location in any case (which makes null all and any claims he may make for this and related verses) it is not unreasonable to make enquiry of the Qur\u2019an on a logical and contextual basis even in those places where the Traditionalist\u2019s claims are both highly specific and objectively false.",139],[2,125,7,"7.

The remainder use this form of the \u1e6d-h-r root to denote cleansing people: hearts, bodies or clothes. Nowhere is it used with anything not directly connected to the human condition. The verse at 33:33 is particularly interesting in this regard as it mentions cleansing the people of the house. While these facts do not \u2014 taken in isolation \u2014 conclusively dispatch the Traditionalist\u2019s claims for this verse (namely, those of cleansing a temple of idols), they should be known by any serious student of the Qur\u2019an.",200],[2,125,9,"9. Arabic: bayt \u2014 house, household. Again, this phrase may indeed relate to the cleansing of a particular physical house in which God was worshipped as the Traditionalist claims; I find this unlikely given the usage of the verb across the broader text, but I do not know and cannot prove a case one way or the other. And nor can the Traditionalist \u2014 at least not on the basis of Qur\u2019anic facts. If his inclination happens to correspond with reality and what is meant here is, in fact, a physical house, the place which the verse references is now lost to us (since Petra is now a ruin, and 9:28 closes this chapter of history conclusively). However, the statement can also be understood in a way which does have Qur\u2019anic support and which can serve as a lesson today if we take the house which Ibr\u0101him sought to purify to be that of his own family line (which is the point of the entire section at 2:125-141). Ibr\u0101h\u012bm is, by common consent, the great Patriarch and example of monotheistic belief. The job of his descendants was to be pure and take monotheism to the world.

This root requires some attention since words built upon aspects of it comprise part of the Traditionalist\u2019s \u2018religious\u2019 vocabulary. I mean by \u2018religious\u2019 vocabulary that subset of the total Qur\u2019anic lexicon to which the Traditionalist ascribes (usually inconsistently where such terms occur in multiple contexts) highly specialised definitions. He then trades on those highly specialised definitions to create in the minds of the ignorant, gullible, or inattentive the impression of correspondence between his religion (all details pursuant to which are taken from outside the Qur\u2019an), and the Qur\u2019anic text itself. Where a large number of contexts exist in the Qur\u2019anic text (such as with \u1e63al\u0101t, for example) his deceits are relatively easily exposed by inductive reasoning and methodical analysis. While words based on the \u1e6d-w-f root occur less frequently than those based on the root of \u1e63al\u0101t, we still have something to work with and, as we shall see, on this occasion the Traditionalist\u2019s pre-existing requirements force him to open the hole which traps him. So what is the Traditionalist\u2019s pre-existing requirement? It is that he needs words based on this root \u2014 occasionally, but not consistently \u2014 to mean to perform circumambulation (by which term he means the execution of a solemn, religious rite comprising walking around more than one holy site, the details of which are nowhere in the Qur\u2019an, but which he, the Traditionalist, says are important and claims to know). He must achieve this because he is committed to a broader event he calls \u1e25ajj as one of the five pillars which comprise his religion (mention of said pillars is, likewise, nowhere found in the Qur\u2019an), and his specialised value of circumambulation is claimed by him to be a component of that broader event. He must make this event and what he says are its components seem native to the Qur\u2019anic text since he claims the Qur\u2019an as the source document for his religion. Now that the Traditionalist\u2019s objective has been established, the reader can review what follows to form an opinion on how successful he has been in the case of the word under consideration. Words based on the \u1e6d-w-f root occur a total of 41 times in six forms. The forms which are of interest here are the form I verb (37:45, 43:71, 52:24, 55:44, 56:17, 68:19, 76:15, 76:19), the associated form I active participle (2:125, 7:201, 22:26, 68:19), and the form V verb (2:158, 22:29). The mundane (non-religious) meaning of the form I verb is to go about, walk about, travel about; with \u02bfal\u0101 it means to circulate, make rounds, walk about (\u02bfal\u0101 among e.g. people). With bi it acquires other nuances such as to come to know; to familiarise oneself with. The form V verb is given similarly mundane senses by Wehr (p. 671) of to move about, rove, roam, wander, walk about. The form V occurs twice (2:158, 22:29), and both times in the context of what the Traditionalist calls \u1e25ajj. Usually, a single context makes it easier to claim highly specific \u2018religious\u2019 values \u2014 here: to perform circumambulation \u2014 without challenge, but this instance causes the Traditionalist a problem, albeit one which is not apparent to the casual observer. While the verb and preposition are the same in each case \u2014 ta\u1e6dawwafa (form V) plus bi \u2014 at 2:158 the object is dual, whereas at 22:29 the object is singular. Thus, no matter what one decides is the precise scenario in each case, given the Traditionalist\u2019s requirement of a highly specialised \u2018religious\u2019 sense in both cases, the net effect is a weakening of the power of his assertion, which is left potentially more vulnerable to ridicule than if he could point to a solidly uniform implementation for his value of religious circumambulation. However, his boat truly springs a leak at the point he extends his required meaning beyond the form V verb to include the form I participle at two places (2:125, 22:26). Doctrinally, he has no choice but to ascribe there the same specialist meaning he ascribes to the form V verb if he is to seem to achieve the outcome we identified above. This requirement necessitates admission of all instances of the form I verb (37:45, 43:71, 52:24, 55:44, 56:17, 68:19, 76:15, 76:19) and the two remaining instances of the form I participle (7:201, 68:19) to the dataset. Most people take no notice of such details, naturally. But once noticed they are deadly to the impression the Traditionalist is committed to achieving since detailed analysis of this broader dataset places his specialised definition at 2:125 and 22:26 in open conflict with a broader sampling of Qur\u2019anic usage. In our own presentation of the text the mundane, non-specialised senses of all forms mentioned in this note fit naturally everywhere. And in those cases where the Traditionalist requires his specialised meaning, our mundane, non-specialised values comport fully with a scenario located at Petra where the visitor would be expected to walk about the numerous graves there to pay respects to his ancestors. While I think this is genuinely the meaning, I do not argue on that basis; partly because I do not need to (see note to 9:28), partly because I do not want my findings to be ascribed the force of doctrine by others, and partly because I do not think the precise details matter here (at least, they matter here no more than those of any other historical event the Qur\u2019an mentions). I do, however, deny the Traditionalist the right to arrogate Qur\u2019anic histories to his cult-building project and then to insist upon my compliance with his extraneous narratives on the basis of values one can prove he applies to Qur\u2019anic terms on an entirely ad hoc basis. Also, the Traditionalist\u2019s assertions fail further when we consider Mecca as the place of pilgrimage on the basis of the Qur\u2019anic text (see Notepad XVI). I do not contest this point with the Traditionalist in my translation, and confine my dissent to the notes. The broader question is entirely moot since al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m was closed to believers within the time of the revelation (see note to 9:28, and my book The God Protocol). All instances of the root covered by this note reference this verse.",238],[2,125,11,"11. Arabic: \u02bfakafa \u2014 to be devoted (to), to remain (in or at).",262],[2,125,12,"12.

The Traditionalist claims this verse to indicate the raising of physical foundations of a building; namely, that of a building in Mecca which he calls the ka\u02bfba. I reject the possibility that he is factually correct out of hand given the impossibility of Mecca as the site of Ibr\u0101him\u2019s sanctuary (see Notepad XVI). However, some may decide that even though the Traditionalist is fixated upon the wrong location he is correct about the general sense of the verse so I will address the broader subject on the basis of etymology. This form of the root r-f-\u02bf (which the Traditionalist takes here to mean to raise physically) occurs 22 times in the Qur\u2019an (2:63, 2:93, 2:127, 2:253, 4:154, 4:158, 6:83, 6:165, 7:176, 12:76, 12:100, 13:2, 19:57, 24:36, 35:10, 43:32, 49:2, 55:7, 58:11, 79:28, 88:18, 94:4); leaving aside the verse here at 2:127 and that at 24:36 (both of which relate to bayt or its plural) nowhere does this verb form relate to the creation of physical structures by men. That is not to say that I claim that the Traditionalist\u2019s general thesis \u2014 location notwithstanding \u2014 is objectively wrong. I don\u2019t know. And, frankly, nor does he. My position is that to base core theological doctrine on ambiguous statements is not acceptable. What is acceptable in circumstances such as these is to look at the preponderance of Qur\u2019anic evidence. And on that basis, I feel justified in asserting that the word here means to elevate and ascribing to qaw\u0101\u02bfid its non-physical sense of precepts given a Qur\u2019anic context which treats of Ibr\u0101him creating a family, a dynasty, a faith. I find it more reasonable given the preponderance of Qur\u2019anic evidence that a man who had left his tribe (which represented his worldly status, support and protection) because he would not follow its cult of created idols would then begin a new tribe based on purely monotheistic precepts free of idolatry than I do that he would build a new idol in the desert and begin bowing down to that. I cannot prove objectively that my thesis is correct; I simply argue that it makes more sense, given the Qur\u2019anic evidence, than popular and persistent alternate assertions. See note to qaw\u0101\u02bfid which follows. In this edition, I give the point to the Traditionalist in my translation, and confine my dissent to the notes. The broader question is entirely moot since al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m was closed to believers within the time of the revelation (see note to 9:28, and my book The God Protocol). All instances of the root covered by this note reference this verse.",36],[2,127,3,"3. Arabic: qaw\u0101\u02bfid. The Traditionalist has it that this word relates to a physical building and he interprets it as foundations in the sense of structural foundations. While I do not claim historical objectivity for my own understanding, I do know that the Traditionalist has none for his, at least as far as his narrative relates to the city of Mecca. What I argue is that the preponderance of Qur\u2019anic evidence is against the Traditionalist\u2019s core claim at this point, no matter where located (see note to 9:28 and my book The God Protocol). This form of the q-\u02bf-d root occurs three times in the Qur\u2019an (2:127, 16:26 and 24:60). At 24:60 the word relates to women specifically and we can disregard it for the purposes of our discussion here. While the remaining verse at 16:26 does relate to the foundations of a building \u2014 a fact which might seem to lend support to the Traditionalist\u2019s view \u2014 it is an unassailable fact that 16:26 can only be interpreted (and is, in fact, translated by the Traditionalist himself) as a non-physical house. My argument, then, is: if qaw\u0101\u02bfid unequivocally indicate the metaphorical foundations of a metaphorical house at 16:26, at 2:127 it makes more sense to assume an equivalent value for the word than it does to assign a contrary value to it on the basis of no hard internal evidence. The word qaw\u0101\u02bfid legitimately means bases, groundwork, foundations and basic teachings (the latter found, for example, in the Arabic expression: qaw\u0101\u02bfid ad-d\u012bn). It is on the basis of these considerations that I understand qaw\u0101\u2019id here as precepts. In this edition, I give the point to the Traditionalist in my translation, and confine my dissent to the notes. The broader question is entirely moot since al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m was closed to believers within the time of the revelation (see note to 9:28, and my book The God Protocol).

But if he does, he has no Qur\u2019anic support for such claims; the fact is that the Qur\u2019an leaves the case open. The injection of religious certitude drawn from other sources into matters which God left open has no validity in the methodology used here. Also of note is the fact that it says here man\u0101sikan\u0101 (our rites). It does not say the rites for all time, or even your rites, but our rites (cf. 2:141).

This clause occurs at 2:136, 2:140, 3:84 and 4:163. While where this formula appears what follows it differs in each case, the leading statement and word order are stable: to Ibr\u0101him, and Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl, and Is\u1e25\u0101q, and Ya\u02bfq\u016bb and al asb\u0101\u1e6d. The Arabic word asb\u0101\u1e6d has two possible meanings: grandsons or tribes. Traditionalist translations generally employ Tribes, but Saheeh International has attempted to embrace both senses with Descendants. I render Grandsons in all comparable cases, and I do so for the following reasons: 2:136 and 3:84 speak of what was sent down to or upon the categories listed, and we learn at 4:163 that al asb\u0101\u1e6d received wa\u1e25\u012b (instruction or inspiration from God). We also know that among Ibr\u0101him\u2019s broader progeny there would be those who disregard God (2:124). Since we know that men who disregard God do not receive wa\u1e25\u012b \u2014 and we know that there have been countless ungodly men among the \u2018Tribes\u2019 \u2014 it is not unreasonable to consider grandsons as the possible value. If we proceed on that basis, it is interesting to note that the formula always states Ya\u02bfq\u016bb and al asb\u0101\u1e6d. The principal figure, of course, is Ibr\u0101him. Ya\u02bfq\u016bb is himself a grandson of Ibr\u0101him via Is\u1e25\u0101q. However, (according to the Hebrew scriptures) Jacob had a twin brother Esau, and Abraham had other sons: Ishmael by Hagar and another six sons by Keturah: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. That all of Ibr\u0101him\u2019s grandsons \u2014 of whom Ya\u02bfq\u016bb was one, and which number included the sons of Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl and Ibr\u0101him\u2019s other sons \u2014 received instruction from God is something I can accept as correct. That all members of the tribes descended from Ya\u02bfq\u016bb received instruction from God (and are de facto godly men) is something I know is not true. This point, incidentally, fits with the broader thesis that Ibr\u0101him\u2019s primary mission was to create a new line of men who would found families and tribes submitted to God alone. All instances appear in the notes and reference this verse. The word asb\u0101\u1e6d also occurs without the article at 7:160 and there clearly does denote tribes.",146],[2,136,3,"3.

I.e. who is more unjust than one who persists with something he knows to be untrue in his faith?",235],[2,142,1,"1. Arabic: qiblah. Whereas qiblah can mean focus or direction or general course (and such a reading fits the context), the Traditionalist inserts \u2014 and insists upon \u2014 a highly subjective, specialised and cultic value for qiblah, that of direction of prayer. This value is not sustained by Qur\u2019anic usage and context; rather, it is antagonistic to both. For example, what directly follows talks of \u2018guidance\u2019 and a \u2018straight path\u2019 \u2014 both of which are general moral, not physical concepts; yet the Traditionalist claims qiblah to have a highly specific and physical connotation. Here and in the verses which follow, bowing is nowhere mentioned and the Traditionalist cannot even point to his value for \u1e63al\u0101t. Rather, the context dismisses adherence to assumption and dogma (2:140) and emphasises the importance of individual responsibility over merits of group membership or precedent (2:141). In the only other context in which it occurs (10:87), qiblah can only sensibly mean focus, purpose, goal, course or direction, that to which one directs one\u2019s attention \u2014 which are acceptable values for the term \u2014 and is often rendered there along those lines by the Traditionalist. I stand by my principle of not allowing subjective, specialised values to supplant established common meanings, and render qiblah here accordingly as course here and as destination at 10:87. It is true historically that Muslims have built places of worship and that those places face a number of directions and that each instance of such a direction is today called a qiblah. These facts are not in question; the question is whether such a value can be ascribed to the Qur\u2019an\u2019s use of this word \u2014 and on the basis of its contents and contexts, it cannot.",75],[2,142,2,"2.

The context, as I understand it, is of a man searching the heavens for his purpose: where to direct his focus, his energy?

This word \u2014 and the root thereof \u2014 occurs only five times in the Qur\u2019an: twice here at 2:144, once at 2:149, and twice more in a repetition of the same notion at 2:150. Clearly, that the same idea is repeated five times in such a small space indicates its importance. The question is: what does it mean? The Traditionalist, as we know, insists upon a requirement here to stand and bow in the direction of a building five times a day in a set of rituals he admits are found nowhere in the Qur\u2019an. However, neither prayer nor rituals of any kind are mentioned in the segment. Much closer to the actual import, I would assert, is the following: we know from clear statements in the Qur\u2019an that the Messenger and those with him were called upon to witness to the people of that time and place, to call them to God alone, and to warn them of the fate of the communities which had previously rejected the men God sent to warn them. The Arabs of the time met together regularly at al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m. That al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m should be made the focus of Mu\u1e25ammad\u2019s mission is logical, since it was there that he could be most effective. The mission to al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m was completed in the time of the Messenger (see 2:177 and 9:28 and related notes, as well as note below and my book The God Protocol).",151],[2,144,5,"5. Arabic: al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m. See Notepad VII.ii. The place known as al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m denotes a physical precinct to which Arab tribes performed a pilgrimage to worship, to visit and bury their dead, to trade, and to meet and to talk; that location was not at Mecca, but more likely at Petra in modern-day Jordan (see Notepad XVI). There is no further obligation connected with al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m in any case since the Qur\u2019an clearly indicates the end of its use (see 9:28 and related notes and my book The God Protocol).

Whereas the Traditionalist insists upon a highly specific value for al \u1e63al\u0101t he fully allows that the meaning of al \u1e63abr depends upon circumstances and context. In summary, he acknowledges al \u1e63abr here as a generic noun, but requires a high level of specificity in the case of al \u1e63al\u0101t.

The value I demonstrate in the broader work of duties for \u1e63alaw\u0101t requires no adjustment. The verse here simply tells us that God has committed himself to certain duties with respect to those who remain steadfast and faithful in the face of hardship. God\u2019s duties are his part of the initial covenant found in al f\u0101ti\u1e25ah and summarised at 1:6-7.",21],[2,158,1,"1. al \u1e63af\u0101 and al marwa occur only once each in the text which fact makes them vulnerable to specious interpretation. Here, somewhat predictably, the Traditionalist makes highly specialised claims for his religion (that the two words in question represent rock outcrops at al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m, and that pilgrims historically walked between these two rock outcrops for some purely religious reason; and that one who accepts the Qur\u2019an should do likewise; and that he, the Traditionalist, knows how this should be done). His claims are without foundation in the Qur\u2019an and can in no way be verified on the basis of its text \u2014 a fact which the Traditionalist knows and utilises to gain leverage for his broader claims. I cannot definitely prove that he is wrong in his claims for al \u1e63af\u0101 and al marwa. It is impossible to prove a negative. Therefore, in the interests of intellectual integrity, I should allow that he might be right: perhaps al \u1e63af\u0101 and al marwa do indeed indicate two small rock outcrops \u2014 bereft of Qur\u2019anic substantiation though the assertion is. I admit all manner of things I cannot disprove as abstract possibilities, and I have no reason not to extend the same allowance to the Traditionalist\u2019s claim here. I make no doctrinal claim for the thesis which follows \u2014 in the same way as I deny the Traditionalist the right to impose a theological construct upon me by his reading of this point. My case for the meaning of al \u1e63af\u0101 and al marwa is this: we should remember that the Qur\u2019anic text we read today contains diacritic and other textual accoutrements which are interpretive in nature. This is not unusual for religious texts written in Semitic languages, which are deficient in certain markings in their simplest written forms. Hebrew texts have likewise passed through a process to clarify and standardise their readings. In the earliest Qur\u2019anic text such items as short vowels, hamzas and shaddas were not marked, or were marked inconsistently. This means that in the original unadorned text the two words in question read -l\u1e63f\u0101 and -lmrwh. These can acceptably be pointed as -l\u1e63af\u0101\u2019 and -lmur\u016b\u2019ah, which yields the values felicity and manly generosity respectively, which is what I incline towards, absent better information. These values make sense to me; the Traditionalist\u2019s assumptions, frankly, do not. I leave these two values untranslated. The broader question is entirely moot since al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m was closed to believers within the time of the revelation (see note to 9:28, and my book The God Protocol).",20],[2,158,2,"2. Arabic: sha\u02bf\u0101\u2019ir allah \u2014 the tokens of God. The Traditionalist has it that \u2018the tokens of God\u2019 (2:158, 5:2, 22:32, 22:36) are something particular and vital to his religion. Here, he would have sha\u02bf\u0101\u2019ir allah be two outcrops which he himself has identified, and for which he can provide no Qur\u2019anic proof (see note above). Outside the present context, he is keen to assert sha\u02bf\u0101\u2019ir allah as animals to be sacrificed as part of rites he himself acknowledges to be absent from the Qur\u2019an (see notes to 22:30 and 22:32). A token is something which indicates the existence of something else. The plain meaning of \u2018the tokens of God\u2019 is those things which indicate the existence of God. All instances appear in the notes and reference this verse.",50],[2,158,3,"3. Arabic: \u1e25ajja al bayt. This is the only instance of the verb \u1e25ajja and it occurs in the past tense. The Traditionalist claims, on the basis of no Qur\u2019anic evidence, that \u1e25ajja al bayt means, in effect, perform a set of pilgrimage rites (found nowhere in the Qur\u2019an) at a religious centre (for which there is no genuine Qur\u2019anic support) in Mecca \u2014 a city which, according to Dan Gibson (Quranic Geography, 2011), does not exist on any map until 900 CE. What the text actually says is to \u2018\u1e25ajj\u2019 the house. I accept that the noun \u1e25ajj denotes a pilgrimage in the Qur\u2019an because it is an established historical fact that annual pilgrimages were a feature of life in the region (i.e. to Petra), and because the noun \u1e25ajj is used in all cases in the Qur\u2019an in support of that sense. However, what the reader without access to Arabic may not know is that the root \u1e25-j-j denotes debate or argument and is commonly used in the Qur\u2019an in those senses (form III verb: 2:76, 2:139, 2:258, 3:20, 3:61, 3:65, 3:66, 3:73, 6:80, 6:80, 42:16; form VI verb: 40:47; noun: 2:150, 4:165, 6:83, 6:149, 42:15, 42:16, 45:25). While I do not contend that pilgrimage (\u1e25ajj) as a noun and argument or debate are synonymous, it is beyond question that there is a strong etymological connection between them in Arabic generally, and in the Qur\u2019anic treatment of verbs and nouns based on the \u1e25-j-j root specifically. This fact suggests that the pilgrimage was \u2014 at least in part \u2014 an occasion for debate among those who attended. Rather than attempt to prove that \u1e25ajja al bayt means to debate the house (a point which I can argue, but cannot definitively prove) I have defaulted to the Traditionalist\u2019s own reading since one can safely concede the point to him to no effect given that al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m \u2014 no matter where located \u2014 has long been closed to those who follow the Qur\u2019an as a place of pilgrimage (see note to 9:28).",89],[2,158,4,"4. Arabic: \u2018amara. The form VIII of the verb \u2018amara occurs only once in the text. This makes its value difficult to identify on the basis of pan-textual usage. This instance of the verb is often given an acceptable, though arbitrarily-chosen value by the Traditionalist (to visit), a claim which is then developed and extended into a religious nomenclature for which he has no Qur\u2019anic basis. However, Lane lists the meaning of this verb as to aim at or to purpose (p. 2154). But since I cannot form a strong case for this meaning given the paucity of instances in the text, I have erred on the side of caution and followed the Traditionalist\u2019s predilection. Again, since the locale is held to be al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m it does not matter particularly what this instance of \u2018amara means since al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m is closed as a place of pilgrimage to those who follow the Qur\u2019an (see 9:28) and the verse is now of a historical or analogous value only.",102],[2,158,5,"5.

The three so-called major monotheistic religions are themselves monuments to men\u2019s resolute, institutionalised refusal to implement God\u2019s imperative across the ages; rather, they have built buildings, created racial or factional cabals, and propagated doctrines based in sources other than the revelations the messengers themselves brought.",50],[2,159,2,"2.

The point being made, surely, is that the severity of heat in any month is not a reason to omit to fast (see further notes to this verse below).

The verb \u1e63\u0101ma takes it as a direct object. It is clearly a time phrase since if it denoted fasting from a thing a preposition would indicate that. However, nouns indicating time (day, hour, etc.) when they appear with no preposition indicate on or in (cf. on the day, in the hour). They do not indicate over the course of. Lane (p. 1759) feels he needs to overcome this point explicitly and states that \u1e63\u0101ma ashshuhra (which is the form here) actually means \u1e63\u0101ma f\u012b ashshuhra. What he is trying to do is bring what the Qur\u2019an says (let him fast in it) into line with Traditionalist dogma (let him fast during or over the course of it). It is a difficult concept for certain mentalities to grasp, but the requirement of fasting at 2:185 is the same as that of giving (see Article SZC), or of dowries, good works and other such things: you have to give something (here: fast each month), but how much you give is up to you.",208],[2,185,8,"8.

Nowhere in the Qur\u2019an are particular months mentioned in this regard. The Traditionalist, on the other hand, claims to know exactly what these months are called and when they occur. If the claim is that here what is meant is an inviolable month with regard to the pilgrimage then, clearly, such months were known to those alive at the time of the revelation. These details are not found in the Qur\u2019an because later generations have no need for them \u2014 the pilgrimage is now closed (see 9:28 and Notepad XVI).

Arabic root: \u02bf-m-r. This noun form occurs only twice (here and later in the same verse). The Traditionalist ascribes a highly specific, cultic value to the word (i.e. that of out-of-season \u1e25ajj \u2014 the details of which he claims also to know). The Traditionalist\u2019s claim can demonstrate no purchase upon the text \u2014 a fact which he indirectly acknowledges by dint of his a priori acceptance of (and insistence upon) an entirely different literature. I have rendered in accordance with the word\u2019s non-sectarian and \u2014 in the words of Lane (p. 2207) \u2014 \u2018primary\u2019 signification (which, to be fair to the Traditionalist, is in basic alignment with his claims over the word \u2014 minus the dubious specificity he wishes to ascribe to it, and for us to accept at his hand). However, the final meaning is not of vital importance given the abandonment of al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m in the lifetime of the Messenger (see note to 9:28 as well as my book The God Protocol) and the Traditionalist\u2019s incorrect identification of its location in any case (see Notepad XVI).",47],[2,196,3,"3. Cf. 2:273.",83],[2,196,4,"4. Or requirement. Arabic hadya \u2014 guidance, direction; way, road, course; manner mode, fashion. This word is based on the same root as \u2014 and in its unadorned textual state is visually identical to \u2014 the word translated throughout guidance. The h-d-y root occurs over 250 times in the Qur\u2019an specifically denoting guidance. The Traditionalist claims that hadya (which occurs just 7 times in a total of 5 verses: 2:196, 2:196, 2:196, 5:2, 5:95, 5:97, 48:25) denotes a sacrificial animal to be killed as part of a religious ceremony. I do not accept this value on two grounds: firstly, because it is an instance of ascribing a specialised religious value to a word for the meaning of which there is no Qur\u2019anic proof; secondly, because the value the Traditionalist ascribes to hadya starkly contrasts with the root meanings of that word. Whereas guidance throughout denotes guidance from God, I take hadya to denote guidance conceived of by man \u2014 and that being the case, requirement (in the sense of formal advice or directive) is a fitting value \u2014 and I do so for three reasons: firstly, because it accords with the standard, non-religious dictionary definitions; secondly, because it integrates with the broader semantics of the Arabic root as found in the Qur\u2019an in all other cases; and, thirdly, because it fits all contexts. Where this word occurs in combination with ma\u1e25ill in the formula \u2018until the requirement reaches its destination\u2019 (2:196, 48:25) the value is clearly a collocation denoting \u2018until what should happen occurs\u2019 (see note to 48:25). In this edition, I give the point to the Traditionalist in my translation, and confine my dissent to the notes. The broader question is entirely moot since al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m was closed to believers within the time of the revelation (see note to 9:28, and my book The God Protocol). All instances appear in the notes and reference this verse.",119],[2,196,5,"5. Historically, head-shaving has been associated with piety, initiation, pilgrimage, war, and death. The facts with supportable bases are that \u1e25ajj took place at Petra (see Notepad XVI) where the Nabataean Arabs converged at least once yearly at the sanctuary and burial city there to meet kin, bury their dead, to worship God, to trade, and \u2014 one must assume given the etymological meaning of the \u1e25-j-j root \u2014 to debate, perhaps on questions of ultimate truth. It is my best guess that what is meant here with regard to shaving the head is that a man was to wait until a given day or a particular station in the \u1e25ajj before shaving his head or cutting his hair in order to give him the time to hear out all the arguments before making a decision, a decision which was marked by the shaving of the head; however, these are speculations. Such speculations have no greater theological significance to us now than do speculations regarding the Qur\u2019anic histories of \u02bf\u0100d or Fir\u02bfawn. The \u1e25ajj mentioned in the Qur\u2019an passed into the pages of history around 1,400 years ago. The details and form of that tradition were known to the people for whom Petra represented a cultural, religious, and social centre. If the specific details of that institution were important for all people and all times they would have been included in the Qur\u2019an. They are not included in the Qur\u2019an, a point which the Traditionalist readily (even vociferously) acknowledges. What remains with regard to \u1e25ajj \u2014 as with all other Qur\u2019anic histories \u2014 are principal lessons only. Shaving occurs at one other place (48:27).",145],[2,196,6,"6. Arabic: hadya. See note to 2:196.",165],[2,196,7,"7. Or due time. Arabic: ma\u1e25ill \u2014 place of alighting or stopping, time or place at which an obligation falls due. These are the mundane senses gleaned from Wehr (p. 233) and Lane (p. 625), although Lane goes on to cite the Traditionalist\u2019s highly specific value of place of sacrificial slaughter. This term occurs at three places: 2:196, 22:33, 48:25. All instances treat of a single context (the duty of \u1e25ajj at the time of the Messenger) which fact makes claims for specialised terms difficult to refute on the basis of pan-textual comparison. As the reader will have noticed, the Traditionalist chooses to extend the application for this part of the Qur\u2019anic narrative in a way he would never do for others (see note to 2:125 for his reasons). In this edition, I give the present point to the Traditionalist in my translation, and confine my dissent to the notes.

This form IV verb occurs in 7 places (2:198, 2:199, 2:199, 7:50, 10:61, 24:14, 46:8). The Traditionalist is forced to render this verb arbitrarily to achieve his predefined purposes. What we are looking for is a methodology. This verb has three basic meanings: to speak at length, to expound (either with no preposition, or with a proposition such as f\u012b); to be (fully) engaged in or to abandon oneself to (which meanings take f\u012b); to pour forth (a transitive verb taking an indirect object with \u02bfal\u0101). Having reviewed all instances and found that the case at 24:14 admits of no other reading than to speak at length, to expound I take this as the baseline sense and render accordingly in all cases where that is admissible \u2014 namely, in those cases which do not take an indirect object with \u02bfal\u0101. At 10:61 the particle is f\u012b and the surrounding context requires to be (fully) engaged in or to abandon oneself to as the sense. Where the verb takes \u02bfal\u0101, both the requirements of Arabic and the Qur\u2019anic context dictate that the only possible meaning is to pour forth (in a transitive sense). In this particular case at 2:198, I have elected to render according to the Traditionalist\u2019s assertions \u2014 despite the fact that I reject them \u2014 and to confine my dissent to the notes. The broader question is entirely moot since al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m was closed to believers within the time of the revelation (see note to 9:28, and my book The God Protocol). All instances appear in the notes and reference this verse.",71],[2,198,3,"3. Or subjects known. Arabic: \u02bfaraf\u0101t. This word occurs once only but its root occurs in other forms and has core senses of to recognise, discover, find out, acknowledge as being true. Given the preponderance of words based on this root in the Arabic language, my opinion is that \u02bfaraf\u0101t is a simple plural noun based on a variant of \u02bfarfa (a question, questioning, respecting a subject of information, how to know it \u2014 Lane, p. 2067) and therefore \u02bfaraf\u0101t, as a plural noun, means known subjects, subjects known, or subjects which you know. The Traditionalist affixes a highly arbitrary religious value to this word, one which serves his consistent aim of imposing a series of rites (on which he is the sole expert) upon the contents of the Qur\u2019an (namely, that \u02bfaraf\u0101t is the name of a mountain near Mecca).

Or the inviolable sense. Arabic: mash\u02bfar. This word occurs once and means in Arabic, among other things: sensory urge, sense, feeling or perception. On that basis, then, al mash\u02bfar al \u1e25ar\u0101m surely indicates one\u2019s inner conscience. The interested student may wish to review how this root is presented across all 40 instances in the text and that its dominant senses indicate perception and awareness: 2:9, 2:12, 2:154, 2:158, 2:198, 3:69, 5:2, 6:26, 6:109, 6:123, 7:95, 12:15, 12:107, 16:21, 16:26, 16:45, 16:80, 18:19, 21:5, 22:32, 22:36, 23:56, 26:113, 26:202, 26:224, 27:18, 27:50, 27:65, 28:9, 28:11, 29:53, 36:69, 37:36, 39:25, 39:55, 43:66, 49:2, 52:30, 53:49, 69:41.

I have followed Muhammad Asad in my translation here, and include his excellent comment in full: Lit., \u201che hastens about the earth [or \u201cstrives on earth\u201d] to spread corruption therein and to destroy tilth and progeny\u201d. Most of the commentators see in this sentence an indication of a conscious intent on the part of the person thus described; but it is also possible that the particle li in li-yufsida (generally taken to mean \u201cin order that he might spread corruption\u201d) plays in this context the role of what the grammarians call a lam al-dqibah, \u201cthe [letter] lam used to denote a consequence\u201d- i.e., regardless of the existence or non-existence of a conscious intent. (By rendering the sentence the way I do it, both possibilities are left open.) As regards the expression harth (rendered by me as \u201ctilth\u201d), its primary significance is \u201cgain\u201d or \u201cacquisition\u201d through labour; and thus it often signifies \u201cworldly goods\u201d (see Lane II, 542), and especially the crops obtained by tilling land, as well as the tilled land itself. If harth is understood in this context as \u201ctilth\u201d, it would apply, metaphorically, to human endeavours in general, and to social endeavours in particular. However, some commentators - basing their opinion on the Qur\u2019anic sentence, \u201cyour wives are your tilth\u201d (2:223)- maintain that harth stands here for \u201cwives\u201d (cf. Razi, and the philologist Al-Azhari, as quoted in Manar II, 248): in which case the \u201cdestruction of tilth and progeny\u201d would be synonymous with an upsetting of family life and, consequently, of the entire social fabric. According to either of these two interpretations, the passage has the following meaning: As soon as the mental attitude described above is generally accepted and made the basis of social behaviour, it unavoidably results in widespread moral decay and, consequently, social disintegration.",107],[2,206,1,"1.

Let us remember the surrounding context: God\u2019s rules for right dealings with women. Here, however, the Traditionalist would have the reader believe that 2:238-239 intersects this topic with a reminder to keep up his non-Qur\u2019anic ritual (with special emphasis on one at mid-afternoon), and of maintaining that regime when out and about. This is only achieved by his typical means: shattering the context, inserting specious values for words, interpolation, and reliance upon the reader\u2019s textual ignorance and reluctance to challenge those he considers experts. Traditionalist translators Hilali & Khan, for example, have here: Guard strictly (five obligatory) As-Salawat (the prayers) especially the middle Salat (i.e. the best prayer - \u2018Asr). And stand before Allah with obedience [and do not speak to others during the Salat (prayers)]. And if you fear (an enemy), perform Salat (pray) on foot or riding. And when you are in safety, offer the Salat (prayer) in the manner He has taught you, which you knew not (before). Even the most enthusiastic follower of the Traditionalist senses that such an imposition upon the text ruptures the narrative flow. But with the values we have established in this work, there is no rift in the text: we are to fear God and keep to a moderate course in our dealings with women; to apply the principles we are given the best we can; where we are lacking in knowledge and in an insecure situation, we are to do the best we can with what we know; when we are secure again, we are to verify and improve our knowledge.

The Traditionalist claims a specific and specious religious value for it (namely a middle prayer \u2014 one which he takes to be what he thinks of as the afternoon prayer, and claims to know the details of). The facts as found in the Qur\u2019an are these: the w-s-\u1e6d root occurs 5 times (2:143, 2:238, 5:89, 68:28, 100:5) and in all cases it denotes a middle-point between extremes; the meaning of \u1e63al\u0101t is established on a Qur\u2019anic basis as duty (see note to 2:3 and Article SZC); and the Qur\u2019anically established value for \u1e63al\u0101t fits perfectly with a Qur\u2019anically consistent value for the w-s-\u1e6d root in the context here.",37],[2,238,3,"3. Arabic: \u1e63al\u0101t; i.e. such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3 and Article SZC.",43],[2,238,4,"4. Naturally, the Traditionalist wants to secure a value here which confirms his externally derived prayer regime. However, the construction here is q\u0101ma + li, and we can cross-reference its meaning by looking at the two places where the same construction occurs. In both cases (4:127 and 34:46) the sense is stand in support of, take the side of. This is the only reading which works over all three instances, an assertion which can be confirmed by comparing them and then trying to fit the Traditionalist\u2019s rendering at 2:238 (i.e. stand in prayer to) in the two remaining cases. Cf. also 5:8.",63],[2,238,5,"5. I.e. stand up for God by remaining in prudent fear of him and obeying what he has commanded.",86],[2,239,1,"1. I.e. have reason to fear. See note to 2:182.

Arabic: mutash\u0101bihat \u2014 ambiguous, resemblances, similarities, likenesses (e.g. something knowable only by means of comparison, context, deeper insight and investigation). This can apply to appeals to and descriptions of eternal verities, but also to concerns of this life; for example, the statement: Kill them wheresoever you find them (2:191). The verse is preceded by a clear call to fight only those who fight you and not to transgress bounds; to cite 2:191 without the surrounding context (something practiced both by some of those in favour of brand Islam and by some of those against it) is to twist this Qur\u2019anic imperative into deceit and calumny. The Traditionalist\u2019s highly selective reading of other particular statements may also be cited in this regard. The most common instance of this is the refrain one hears ad nauseam from the Traditionalist: [...]what the Messenger gives you, take it[...] (59:7). Here, he wrests part of a verse out of its context as a cover for opening the floodgates to what is the real basis of his religion: the \u1e25ad\u012bth. The logical, philosophical and factual errors in this one statement used thus are legion.

This verse requires some attention since it features in arguments both for and against the doctrine of taqiyah, which word has come to be associated with a justification for dissimulation or outright falsehood. To begin: any mindset \u2014 \u2018religious\u2019 or otherwise \u2014 which wishes to find justification for lying will find it. To restrict ourselves to the realm of religion, one sees that in Christianity, Paul is much cited by those who wish to achieve such an end (e.g. Rom. , 1 Cor. -23, 2 Cor. -16), while observant Jews ask God to forgive them for the lies they will tell in the coming year in the Kol Nidre ceremony at Yom Kippur. To return to the Qur\u2019anic text, I would make the following points: 1. The word taqiyah (\u062a\u0642\u064a\u0629) is not found in the verse at 3:28 \u2014 or in any other verse of the Qur\u2019an in the standard text \u2014 although it is an accepted variant reading of the standard word tuq\u0101t (\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0629), and the two are regarded by Lane (p. 310) as synonyms, where he provides values covering: what one should fear, or what one should preserve oneself from. 2. The context at 3:28 has a military and political application (treating of the taking of allies). 3. The two verses immediately following 3:28 make plain that the intention of the heart is not hidden from God, and issue sobering warnings in that regard. Now that we have established these points, I would add the following: in military and political matters \u2014 especially when dealing with a superior force \u2014 the ability to mask one\u2019s intentions is vital; the believer can \u2014 in fact, must \u2014 do so, as must any individual or state which wishes to survive. However, the belief and intention in the case of the believer must not be compromised. This is an entirely different case to that which is both practiced by some called Muslims \u2014 or that of which others accuse them \u2014 namely, cynical and outright deception for gain. Both camps should discuss 3:28 only in the context of 3:29-30. Traditionalist translators Hilali & Khan render here: except if you indeed fear a danger from them, while Saheeh International has: except when taking precaution against them in prudence. Non-sectarian translator A. J. Arberry has: unless you have a fear of them, while N. J. Dawood has: except in self-defence. For myself, I take the import to be that we should have taqw\u0101 (prudent fear) and not let our guard down when we are among al k\u0101fir\u016bn, understanding that they are an enemy to us. The value here of the false claimers of guidance for al k\u0101fir\u016bn makes the dissimulation from their side more obvious in translation than is the case in other presentations; to be fully frank and trusting with such people is not virtue, but recklessness.",202],[3,30,1,"1.

Of interest is the fact that under the \u02bfAs\u012br-\u1e24ej\u0101z thesis Maryam, \u02bf\u012as\u0101 and other personalities connected with them lived many centuries earlier, and the stories connected with the Christianity which developed in the 1st century CE are calques upon these original stories, later conflated with embellishments and other historical characters and transposed upon a different geography.

This convention is found twice (3:34, 3:121) and is a defining characteristic of the chapter \u2014 a point which is confirmed by those statements which remind the Messenger that he was not present at such times or places. This mechanism (the use of idh in the manner described above) is observed in the notes accompanying this chapter.",4],[3,36,1,"1. Arabic: maryam. This note expands upon comments found at 3:33. Hebrew texts claim Amram as the father of Moses; and other sources claim \u02bfImr\u0101n as the Arabicised version of Amram. The children of Amram \u2014 according to Hebrew sources \u2014 were Moses, Aaron and Miriam (the latter name Anglicised in the Christian Bible as Mary). An accusation levelled at the Qur\u2019an by its detractors is that it conflates or confuses historical personalities: Miriam (sister of Aaron and Moses) and Miriam or Maryam (i.e. Mary), mother of \u02bf\u012as\u0101 (assumed to be materially the same person as the man known today as Jesus who lived in Palestine 2,000 years ago). The passage here and that at 19:28 where Maryam is called \u2018sister of H\u0101r\u016bn\u2019 are often presented in support of such assertions; such positions assume their conclusions and proceed on that basis.

[\u2026]and the evidence provided by the recently discovered Dead Sea Scrolls strongly supports this view - that the term hawari was popularly used to denote a member of the Essene Brotherhood, a Jewish religious group which existed in Palestine at the time of Jesus, and to which, possibly, he himself belonged. The Essenes were distinguished by their strong insistence on moral purity and unselfish conduct, and always wore white garments as the outward mark of their convictions; and this would satisfactorily explain the name given to them. Asad holds to the dominant Egypt-Palestine thesis and the Christian extension thereof. The competing theses summarised in Notepad XVI and Notepad XVIII would, perhaps, see the Essenes as a sect which carried the teachings of the original \u02bf\u012as\u0101, a man who predated the Yeshua \u2014 or Jesus \u2014 figure by centuries and who was active in Arabia.

This rendering assumes a value for \u1e25assa which I discuss below.",53],[3,152,4,"4. Arabic: \u1e25assa \u2014 to perceive, be aware; to slay. I am wary of the Traditionalist\u2019s handling of this word. He renders it killing, slaying and synonyms. The reader should know that this is the only instance of the form I of \u1e25assa in the text. It is true that \u1e25assa is said, when marked \u1e25issa, to mean to slay in some lexicons, but I cannot tell whether that is a genuine instance of Qur\u2019anic Arabic or a later development which grew out of a culture infested with \u2018prophetic\u2019 traditions. What I can say is that the form III verb occurs three times and means to perceive in all cases (3:52, 19:98, 21:12). The form V verb occurs just once and means to enquire (12:87). The noun occurs once at 21:102 and indicates sound (i.e. a sound which can just be perceived). On this backdrop, the claim for a single instance of the form I verb as to slay, to kill should be treated with scepticism, especially in a context where to be aware makes sense and to slay makes almost none. One may lose heart when one becomes aware of an enemy, but when speaking of losing heart to slay ill fits the context. The passage and what follows treat of cowardice and failure in battle, not of a lack of motivation to slaughter remaining enemies.",69],[3,152,5,"5. Arabic: \u1e25att\u0101 idh\u0101. This collocation is rendered generally by translators as until when \u2014 and this is its function today in Arabic. However, a detailed review of all instances of \u1e25att\u0101 idh\u0101 in the Qur\u2019an reveals another nuance. Here, the sense is consistently: when + the perfective mood (e.g. And when he had reached the sea) and I have rendered accordingly throughout.

The collocation here is bent into various shapes by translators. For example, Saheeh International has here: another faction worried about themselves; while Hilali & Khan have: while another party was thinking about themselves (as how to save their own selves, ignoring the others and the Prophet SAW). Standard dictionaries such as Wehr (p. 1210) list meanings as: to grieve, distress, concern; to be on one\u2019s mind; to worry, to trouble \u2014 all of which take a direct object, as here. Here, anfusuhum (their souls; their selves) is the subject. Thus the sense which holds most weight on that basis, is a reflexive value based in grieved or distressed, which is how Arabist A. J. Arberry renders the segment: and a party themselves had grieved; and I follow his logic, though not his exact wording.",125],[3,154,2,"2. Arabic: al \u1e25aqq.

After consideration of all instances (3:159, 12:67, 14:12, 39:38) it is clear that what is meant is those who would place their trust aright (i.e. they intend to place it where it is justified). The following verse argues in favour of such a course. All instances appear in the notes and reference this verse.",363],[3,160,1,"1. I.e. when he has forsaken you.",103],[3,160,2,"2.

However, typically, the Traditionalist is committed here to his theme of war booty, and renders accordingly. Arabist A. J. Arberry, however, focuses here on fraudulent, and Muhammad Asad uses deceive (which meanings are found in addition to those supplied by Wehr, in Lane, p. 2332), and Asad supplies the following comment: I.e., by attributing his own opinions to God, and then appealing to the believers to place their trust in Him alone.

Muhammad Asad supplies an alternative meaning. While I do not embrace his acceptance of Islamic history uncritically, I provide his comment here in full: Some commentators (e.g., Razi) assume that the expression ma antum \u2018alayhi (lit.. \u201cthat upon which you are\u201d) denotes here \u201cthe condition in which you are\u201d - i.e., the state of weakness and confusion in which the Muslim community found itself after the battle of Uhud - and that, therefore, this passage is addressed to the believers. This interpretation, however, is not plausible. Apart from the fact that the believers are here referred to in the third person, while ma antum \u2018alayhi is in the second person plural, the latter expression denotes almost invariably, both in the Qur\u2019an and in the Traditions, people\u2019s mode of life and beliefs. Moreover, we have reliable reports to the effect that Ibn \u2018Abbas, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Muqatil and Al-Kalbi unhesitatingly declared that the people addressed here are \u201cthose who deny the truth\u201d to whom the preceding passages refer (see Tabari\u2019s and Baghawi\u2019s commentaries on this verse).

The Traditionalist applies meanings here to the verb from which he shies away in other contexts so that he might achieve his predetermined goal: namely, the right to dole out the brutality and violence he justifies on the basis of the literature he prefers to the Qur\u2019an. By doing proper research, one sees that the values he prefers here (such as punish) are unsustainable on any pan-textual basis. (There exists a Qur\u2019anically-based punishment for those found guilty of the act under discussion here, but no such punishment is mentioned or called for at this particular juncture.) Part of the Traditionalist\u2019s abiding problem is that he is unable \u2014 at least on the basis of observable data \u2014 to understand the point of this legislation; he is, as one typically pictures him, straining for any opportunity to stage a lynching; to inflict unspeakable terror upon some poor, usually powerless individual (generally female), which spectacle helps deflect attention from his own towering incompetence and conspicuous lack of achievement. The purpose of the directive which has eluded him is, nevertheless, instantly clear to someone capable of rational thought, and it is this: it exists to set a society on a course which inclines towards virtue rather than away from it. We don\u2019t have to go far for an example since such a society existed in most Western countries until WWII. In a society of such a type, if a man and a woman are determined to have illicit sexual relations, nothing and no one can stop them given sufficient resources and opportunity. However, the society at large is not calibrated to facilitate such activity and does not condone such behaviour by providing social acceptance, hotel rooms, or collusion, etc. To look at this entire question of legislation objectively, one is struck by the fact that in order to be found guilty a couple would have to be so breathtakingly indiscreet that any subsequent punishment might be said to be justified on the basis of stupidity \u2014 were it not on the basis of immorality \u2014 given the lengths one would have go to in order to be caught. None of this interests the Traditionalist, of course. He does not follow the Qur\u2019anic directives; where murdering people is concerned he is nothing if not inventive \u2014 and he claims that the Qur\u2019an is abrogated by the \u2018sunnah\u2019 of the Prophet (the expression sunnah of the Prophet being shorthand for an endless list of things \u2014 an unspecified number of which are horrific, stupid, and extremely unfair \u2014 which he, the Traditionalist wants to do, and which are not in the Qur\u2019an). The false claimers of guidance are described at length in the Qur\u2019an. They do not end well; the best advice one can offer is to be sure not to be one of them.

In Qur\u2019anic usage waratha + direct object (as here) means to inherit from (see an example at 4:11) and not to inherit (e.g. something). Though I was unaware of Muhammad Asad\u2019s thought on this subject at the time of my analysis, I include part of this comment here for broader context: According to one of the interpretations advanced by Zamakhshari, this refers to a man\u2019s forcibly keeping an unloved wife - and thus preventing her from marrying another man - in the hope of inheriting her property under the provisions specified in the first sentence of verse 12 above.",91],[4,19,3,"3.

Marriage in the Qur\u2019an is based in reality, not in fleeting, elusive, and changing emotions such as the nonsense promoted by media currently about \u2018romance\u2019, and pumped into the minds of both sexes via electronic delivery systems. Outside of such indoctrination, naturally, women wish to invest their youth and charms in men who are stronger, richer, and cleverer than are they; and, naturally, men wish to invest their resources and energies in women who are attractive, virtuous, obedient, and appreciative (cf. 4:34). By founding the marriage contract in an agreement of a material nature, the couple (in concert with their families) can establish the relationship upon reality, and thus increase the chances of creating a successful union and secure environment for their children. Western countries baulk at the notion of setting a price for the man to cross the threshold to marriage, claiming that feelings are what matters. Thus, men are hoodwinked into entering into a formal, binding, legal contract in which women have no formal, binding, legal obligations, and upon which women are encouraged to renege at will; the society thinks nothing of supporting the woman in destroying the man financially, and depriving children of a father, once the \u2018feelings\u2019 of the woman change \u2014 which they frequently do given the typical modern woman\u2019s indoctrination inputs (entertainment, education, etc.). Viewed objectively, the current Western model is both barbaric and evil, and constitutes a systematic transfer of wealth from the hands of those with a higher potential to generate independence through wealth (men), into the hands of those with a lower ability to do so (women). Under this form of soft tyranny, men\u2019s wealth-creating power is taken from them by the state, and substantially frittered away by women on consumption items of no lasting value; thus, the society as a whole is made dysfunctional and dependent upon the state, and is more easily manipulated by the elites than would otherwise be the case.",253],[4,24,6,"6.

Various imaginative interpretations of this instance of this word exist, particularly among more \u2018modernised\u2019 and \u2018modernising\u2019 Muslims. Their efforts notwithstanding, the verb \u1e0daraba still does mean to beat or spank or strike and in the context here there is little else that it could mean. Naturally, this single clause can be wrest from its context and made much of by people who feel that they benefit from so doing. I leave such people to enjoy whatever it is they think they gain from their activities; we all go to God. My position is this: the judicious spanking of a recalcitrant wife has been practiced by husbands who wished to achieve and maintain domestic harmony since time immemorial. It is recommended in the medieval Russian Orthodox handbook \u0414\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439 (Domostroi), for example, and was practiced commonly in both ancient and later Western culture prior to the moral degradation which began in earnest following WWI and then with accelerated force following WWII. However, wife-spanking is still practiced today quite widely within certain Christian circles, and information attesting to its efficacy and value within both religious and non-religious households is not difficult to find. Contemporary liberals will be outraged by these facts, just as they are outraged by most facts. The high divorce rates, confusion of roles, demonstrable dysfunction, moral relativity, and celebration of blatant perversion which are standard fare among the victims of Cultural Marxism serve as an indication of the extent to which one should be guided by such people. Some women prefer a man who is forceful \u2014 they simply do. If a woman has grown up with a father who is strict, it will be difficult for her to respect a man who lets her manipulate or belittle him. In addition, many married couples attest to the fact that when the man takes full charge of his wife, it both saves the marriage and infuses it with vital energy and commitment. In the Qur\u2019anic context, one must not forget that this verse is directed to those who heed warning (see 4:29). Both parties accept the Qur\u2019an and have access to it. The woman will know that if she pushes the man far enough he must \u2014 in keeping with the Qur\u2019an \u2014 respond eventually as outlined at 4:34. She can, of course, initiate separation proceedings at any time. If she has not done so, and has pushed her husband beyond admonishment and separate sleeping arrangements, it is reasonable to assume that she is in tacit agreement with what is to follow.

Arabic: \u1e63al\u0101t; i.e. such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3 and Article SZC. Generically, \u1e63al\u0101t denotes duty. In its primary sense it is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement at 1:5 forms our part \u2014 commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every man has to acknowledge God\u2019s authority (see 7:172). In the present context, the preceding segment (at least from 4:36 to this point and, more fully, from the beginning of the chapter) makes a strong argument in favour of the core Qur\u2019anic doctrine; it summarises what one is signing up for. The verse at 4:43 then addresses those who have heeded what precedes. I understand the approach to the duty here as a point at which one may choose to make a serious undertaking to accept the doctrine of God and make a public statement to that effect. The actual contract between the Lord and his servant is found at 1:1-7, aptly placed at the very beginning of the Qur\u2019an. It is my opinion that the prayer system of the Traditionalist retains in vestigial form the original acceptance statement of Qur\u2019anic principles by dint of its inclusion of al f\u0101ti\u1e25ah in every unit of its prayer system \u2014 despite the fact that few, if any, of those called Muslims today guess at its primary significance or purpose.",46],[4,43,3,"3. The instance here of the form VIII of the verb ghasala is the only one in the text. This fact makes it vulnerable to the Traditionalist\u2019s practice of ascribing highly specialised values to rare or unique terms \u2014 values which have no explicit Qur\u2019anic basis \u2014 and this opportunity has not been overlooked. The objective facts are these: the gh-s-l root occurs a total of four times (4:43, 5:6, 38:42, 69:36). Certainly, the gh-s-l root means to wash; and in Arabic today the form VIII verb has a reflexive sense both of to wash and to wash completely. The Traditionalist, for his part, generally claims two types of \u2018religious\u2019 washing: ghusl and wudhu. By ghusl he means a full-body wash (which is what he claims at this verse). By wudhu he means the washing method (with some embellishments of his own) outlined at 5:6. He has criteria for when either ghusl or wudhu should be done. These criteria do not correlate with the scenarios given at either 4:43 or 5:6 (for example, he claims that what he calls ghusl is needed after contact with women but not that it is needed after defecation). The terms ghusl and wudhu are nowhere found in the Qur\u2019an. These are verifiable facts. My understanding based on the methodology here is this: what is meant by unclean is made clear in the sentence following the expression then find not water (namely: after illness, a journey, defecation or sexual intercourse). This is a concession \u2014 what to do when one does not find water. What, then, is to be done in the case where water is to be found? That instruction is given at 5:6. The correlating verse at 5:6 does not use the form VIII of the verb ghasala to describe the washing process; it bears no relation to the non-Qur\u2019anic word ghusl. It uses another expression: purify yourself (based on the \u1e6d-h-r root). What purify yourself means in the context is, likewise, understood by inference from the concessive allowance at that verse, one which is identical to that at 4:43. On this basis, my conclusions are these: the words for washing at 4:43 and 5:6 mean the same thing; the washing requirement for both cases (given access to water) is outlined at 5:6; the terms ghusl and wudhu have no Qur\u2019anic basis (there being no case in which ghusl as understood by the Traditionalist is a Qur\u2019anic requirement, and his requirement for what he calls wudhu exceeds that mentioned in the Qur\u2019an). I am not arguing against washing fully after sexual contact; I am arguing against ascribing to the revealed word of God values it does not contain. Human washing practices and requirements over and above what is specified in the text are a matter of personal taste and judgment, and not of revealed imperative.",181],[4,43,4,"4.

This word occurs only once and is not of Arabic origin. There is a number of words in the Qur\u2019anic text which are of Syriac and other origin. The existence of words of foreign origin is advanced as an argument against the purity of the Qur\u2019an, an argument which reveals its inherent weakness once we apply such a standard to any other language (for example, English). I have been guided to some extent by Muhammad Asad here who comments: The word al-jibt - rendered by me as \u201cbaseless mysteries\u201d - is probably, as the Lisan al-\u2019Arab points out, of non-Arabic origin. It denotes, according to some authorities, \u201csomething which is worthless in itself\u201d or \u201csomething in which there is no good\u201d (Qamus, Baydawi); according to others, it signifies \u201cenchantment\u201d (Umar ibn al-Khattab, Mujahid and Sha\u2019bi as quoted by Tabari; also Qamus); others, again, interpret it as \u201canything that is worshipped instead of God\u201d (Zamakhshari), and consequently apply it also to idols and idol-worship (Qamus, Lisan al-\u2019Arab)[...]. Taking all these interpretations into account, al-jibt may be defined as \u201ca combination of confusing ideas (dijl), fanciful surmises (awham) and fictitious stories (khurafat)\u201d (Manar V, 157) - in other words, abstruse mysteries without any foundation in fact. The modern embodiment of such a concept is Hollywood: lies built upon dreams upon a mirage which then suck the illusion-addict into false stories with embedded, weaponised, impoverished morals designed to make him depraved. I would add to this category fraudulent science \u2014 which today has all but merged with Hollywood \u2014 predicated on its chief stars Newton, Darwin, Einstein, and NASA, and mainstream media which is run by the same people and provides nothing more than a parody of journalism.",84],[4,51,5,"5.

At 4:85, however, translations vary markedly, with some emphasising values of power or control (A. J. Arberry and N. J. Dawood), others of watching or witness (Muhammad Asad and Hilali & Khan), and others of keeping (Saheeh International). The question of the origins of these divergent interpretations is beyond the remit of the present work.

The Traditionalist thinks this passage treats of the Messenger leading the faithful in prayer in the field, but an attentive reading shows this not to be the case. Admittedly, one needs to concentrate (4:82 implies strongly that this will be a requirement), to understand that this segment begins at 4:75, and to realise that each point it treats of develops the narrative. But when one is not welded to a preconceived value for \u1e63al\u0101t and no longer needs to fight the text to achieve predetermined religious outcomes, a clear picture comes into view. This narrative treats of a rescue mission, one focused upon freeing those held under oppression with no means to free themselves. See note to 2:3 and Article SZC.",8],[4,102,2,"2. I.e. of those who ignore warning.",30],[4,102,3,"3. Arabic: al \u1e63al\u0101t; i.e. such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3 and Article SZC. By taking an object via la this collocation is made something one does for someone else \u2014 which is how the Traditionalist treats the text here also, but with very different results. For him, the Messenger is being told to lead believers in a shortened prayer in the field. It has to mean that because he is locked into his value for al \u1e63al\u0101t. But the scenario is clear if we cease being guided by the Traditionalist\u2019s preconceived values, and derive our values from the Qur\u2019an\u2019s own usage while remembering the context. In this latter case, the Messenger upholds the \u1e63al\u0101t (i.e. initiates into monotheistic submission to God) each of those who wishes to emigrate (cf. 2:2 and notes thereto; also 1:1-7). Thus, the order of events in view here is as follows: the army of the believers arrives, and demands the release of the oppressed (but only if it can do so without undue fear, as per 4:101); the oppressed are brought in batches by those who ignore warning; whatever payment or other arrangements are transacted by the leader of the army of the believers with his opposite number; those who ignore warning then withdraw.

Such a conclusion is possible only if one imports one\u2019s values into the Qur\u2019anic text from elsewhere then reads the result in a way which is contingent upon a pre-existing set of conclusions while choosing to disregard the fact that those values do not fit the text into which they are imported in a number of cases. The plain reading of the text without such an overlay imposed upon it is that our duty to God is not open-ended; it has a beginning and an end.

That understanding is, perhaps, at odds with what Qur\u2019anic usage indicates. In the Qur\u2019an, Fir\u02bfawn is called the Lord of Stakes (38:12, 89:10) \u2014 which collocation is typically rendered thus by the Traditionalist himself. This fact certainly suggests that the form of capital punishment meted out by Fir\u02bfawn featured a stake. The options available for killing a man on a stake are limited. In close proximity to the verb commonly rendered crucify (\u1e63alaba) Fir\u02bfawn threatens that punishment will be inflicted \u2018on the trunks of date-palms\u2019 (20:71) \u2014 thus lending credence to the notion that the trunks of date-palms were trimmed and sharpened to facilitate impalement. In addition, Fir\u02bfawn threatens to cut off hands and feet from alternate sides before executing the punishment in question (7:124, 20:71, 26:49). Attempting to crucify one thus disfigured would be both impractical and run the risk of creating morbid farce \u2014 which itself would defeat the point of most of what benefits a tyrant from the public torture of his enemies: the creation of fear. Finally, a date-palm does not possess a crossbar, nor can one readily be made from a second date-palm \u2014 a requisite item if we are discussing crucifixion in an intellectually honest manner.

Arabic: shubbiha \u2014 to be made similar, to be made uncertain or doubtful. The core fact here is plain: they did not kill him. The implications are immediate and obvious for both Christians and Jews, as well as for relations between the two groups. Under the Islamic extension of the Christian extension of the dominant Jewish Egypt-Palestine thesis, it is supposed that the likeness of \u02bf\u012as\u0101 fell upon another man who was killed in his stead. Under the \u02bfAs\u012br-\u1e24ej\u0101z thesis, \u02bf\u012as\u0101 is an entirely separate individual to that killed at Jerusalem in the 1st century CE, one who lived centuries beforehand and was conflated by Paul with that Yeshua who was killed at Jerusalem and other figures to form the Christian mythos, and the Jews simply killed \u2014 or had killed by the agency of the Romans \u2014 the wrong man, believing him to be the messiah.

This verse has been the subject of interesting but unconvincing interpretations regarding the death and subsequent status of \u02bf\u012as\u0101. The Traditionalist presentation is frequently confused and confusing, and the Hilali & Khan translation is typical in this regard: And there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), but must believe in him [\u2018Iesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), as only a Messenger of Allah and a human being], before his [\u2018Iesa (Jesus) or a Jew\u2019s or a Christian\u2019s] death (at the time of the appearance of the angel of death). And on the Day of Resurrection, he [\u2018Iesa (Jesus)] will be a witness against them. Underpinning this presentation is the view that \u02bf\u012as\u0101 has never died. However, this assertion is impossible to sustain across the broader text since a distinct formula which treats of Ya\u1e25ya (whom no one claims never to have died) is employed also with regard to \u02bf\u012as\u0101 (compare 19:15 and 19:33; see also 5:75, 3:55). The syntax requires attention to unpack, but there is a single, cogent argument which runs across the broader segment. The argument is this:\r\n\n4:153 The doctors of the Law ask thee (Mu\u1e25ammad) to bring down upon them a Writ\n4:154 Rehearses the scenario when a Writ was in fact brought down, one brought down for their agreement. The mount was raised above them in confirmation of this agreement. Note: the verb here is rafa\u02bfa (to raise). The agreement is then confirmed.\nThere then follows a list of grievances against the doctors of the Law:\n4:155 Violation of their agreement; their denial of proofs; their killing of prophets\n4:156 Their denial, and calumny against Maryam\n4:157 Their saying that they killed the messiah \u02bf\u012as\u0101, son of Maryam\n\n\n4:158 On the basis of 4:155-4:157 comes the conclusion: God brought it (i.e. the agreement) before him or before himself. The verb rafa\u02bfa + \u2018il\u0101 means to bring before, bring forward as before a judge or king (Lane, p. 1128). That meaning is confirmed by the words immediately following And God is exalted in might and wise (the word wise in Arabic implies sage judgment).\n4:159 There is no doctor of the Law (i.e. true doctor of the Law) save will believe therein (i.e. in the agreement mentioned at 4:153) before his death; And on the Day of Resurrection it (the agreement) will be witness against them.\nVerses 4:160-161 continue with grievances against those who hold to Judaism in general on a different basis",34],[4,159,1,"1. The force of the construction is that coming to faith therein before death is the sine qua non of what it is to be a doctor of the Law; cf. there is no marathon runner but will complete a race of miles.",15],[4,159,2,"2.

The on-the-nose rendering here is: But those firm in knowledge among them and the believers believe in what is sent down[...]. I have used a different word order in the English and some may take issue with that, so I will address what I anticipate to be their concerns. I have strong pan-textual grounds and contextual support for the rendering I have used. To begin with, a second subject often comes in Qur\u2019anic Arabic at the end of the clause, almost as an afterthought (see the following examples 7:155, 7:156, 18:26, 22:37, 24:5, 24:10, 24:20, 24:50, 26:73, 27:18, 27:49, 28:82, 28:83, 34:10, 34:36, 40:71, 43:71, 48:29, 53:62, 57:10, 58:12, 59:8, 93:3). The entire preceding section treats of the Jews, their failings and misdeeds, and both this verse and the verse following indicate and connect with a summary of (mainly Hebrew) patriarchs and key figures. With these facts in view, the phrase in the opening of 4:162 \u2014 among them \u2014 seems implicitly present within each of three categories which follow: [...]the upholders of the duty (among them), and the renderers of purity (among them), and the believers in God and the Last Day (among them). (It is difficult for the Traditionalist to access this point because he is mesmerised by the words \u1e63al\u0101t and zak\u0101t to which he is trained from birth to attach alien, non-Qur\u2019anic values.) My second point is that the concept of mu\u2019min (believer) does not pertain exclusively to those who embrace the Qur\u2019an, or those who are \u2014 or who call themselves \u2014 Muslims, despite the fact that the word has been used historically as though that were the case. There is no direct correlation with belief and any temporal or political grouping. (Rightly understood, a mu\u2019min is one whose condition of soul is imbued with a sampling of Grace by which he inclines towards and appreciates the things of God.) The Qur\u2019anic text objectively regards certain individuals among Christians, Jews and others (as well as those who predate both Jews and Christians) as mu\u2019mins (see 5:43 for example). My position is that the entire passage at 4:153-162 forms one argument and has one focus: the doctors of the Law among the Jews, most of whom are reproved and some of whom are exonerated. There then follows a broader appeal comprising a correlation between what previous messengers received and the present revelation (4:162-170) before the section ends with a final appeal to the doctors of the Law at 4:171.",88],[4,162,5,"5.

See note to 2:257 and Notepad II.iv.",23],[5,1,2,"2. Arabic: \u1e25urum. This word in this form occurs only here and at 5:95 and 5:96. The Traditionalist claims for \u1e25urum a specialised, religious connotation (namely, the state of increased sanctity a man is said to be in when on pilgrimage). Naturally, the Traditionalist controls all definitions and details pursuant to this condition, and his formulations are nowhere found in the Qur\u2019an. The point at which the Traditionalist makes the correlation with pilgrimage is found not in the current exhortation, but in the one following at 5:2 and the connection claimed by the Traditionalist is weak since 5:2 simply prohibits preventing those who wish to visit the inviolable place of worship from so doing (as one prohibition among several). The singular form of the word in question occurs at 16:116 (and means unlawful in the sense of forbidden) in a context which does not admit of any other interpretation. On this basis, I understand the same value here (and at 5:95 and 5:96, the only other instances) for the plural \u1e25urum. It may well be that hunting was forbidden during the time of \u1e25ajj \u2014 the forbidding of hunting by outsiders on land otherwise occupied by other people would certainly be an equitable law \u2014 however, there is no statement here indicating a direct correlation between \u1e25ajj and the prohibition on hunting. Read cold, without a pre-existing anticipation of any extraneous requirement, the segment here deals simply with times when hunting is forbidden as a restriction with a general application. (I am indebted here to Aidid Safar, whose original insights on this point I have developed and systematised.) See also note to \u1e25alal at 5:2. The broader question is entirely moot since al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m was closed to believers within the time of the revelation (see note to 9:28, and my book The God Protocol).

The verb here is the form IV of the \u1e25-l-l root. In all other instances it means to make lawful or be made lawful depending on the mood and by extension can mean to lead or to bring or to settle (see 2:187, 2:275, 3:50, 4:24, 4:160, 5:1, 5:4, 5:4, 5:5, 5:87, 5:96, 7:157, 9:37, 9:37, 14:28, 22:30, 33:50, 35:35, 66:1). The instance here at 5:2 is in the negative (unlike all other cases) and treats of something which is already instituted. Such being the case, I concur with most other translators and have rendered accordingly.",32],[5,2,3,"3. Arabic: sha\u02bf\u0101\u2019ir allah \u2014 the tokens of God.

This word occurs twice only (5:2 and 5:97) and both instances treat of a single context. This leaves little room to assess its meaning from usage. The Traditionalist asserts a highly specialised value here (and presents himself as the authority, naturally, on the right interpretation and application of his specialised value). For him qal\u0101\u2019ida signifies garlands or necklaces (to be put around the necks of animals selected for slaughter). I reject the value of sacrificial animal for hadya as spurious on the basis of provable Arabic values (see note to 2:196). With regard to qal\u0101\u2019ida I prefer to look to the Arabic language, context, and logic for answers than rely on the Traditionalist and his claims. The facts are these: qal\u0101\u2019ida is a plural noun formed from the q-l-d root. The meanings of the q-l-d root focus on the investment of office, awarding authority, or placing in power. It is true that it can mean to adorn with a necklace, but this meaning is clearly secondary and subsequent to the primary meaning, and grew out of the use of the necklace \u2014 or chain \u2014 as a badge of authority or office. Since the context, both here and at 5:97, treats of hunting being forbidden the question arises: by whom? On the basis of these considerations I contend that qal\u0101\u2019ida denotes necklaces in the sense of chains of office and not, as the Traditionalist claims, in the sense of necklaces for sacrificial animals \u2014 a value which one assumes to have been imposed through a syncretic process originating in Hinduism. (Objective, methodical analysis notes the Hinduistic nature of many of the Traditionalist\u2019s rites and practices but finds justification for such practices nowhere in the Qur\u2019an.) In this edition, I give the point to the Traditionalist in my translation, and confine my dissent to the notes. The broader question is entirely moot since al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m was closed to believers within the time of the revelation (see note to 9:28, and my book The God Protocol). Both instances appear in the notes and reference this verse.",122],[5,2,7,"7. Arabic: \u1e25alal \u2014 allowed, permitted; untied, unfastened. The Traditionalist affixes a specialised, purely religious connotation to this word in this case, one which defies corroboration on the basis of the Qur\u2019an. Thus, for the Traditionalist, this instance of this word provides the reverse of what he claims for \u1e25urum (see 5:1 and note thereto) namely, that condition which exists outside the specialised ritual condition he claims as the meaning of \u1e25urum. If he is right, he cannot prove it on the basis of the Qur\u2019an; I suspect it is a later fiction, but I cannot definitively prove my suspicion. However, I hold to my standard argument and methodology: firstly, whatever pilgrimage existed, the rites pursuant to it are long gone because the pilgrimage \u2014 no matter where the original site was found \u2014 was abandoned at the time of the revelation (see note to 9:28, Notepad XVI, and my book The God Protocol); secondly, I insist that consistent application of proven, demonstrable Qur\u2019anic values prevail in all instances of a particular term \u2014 including in those cases where the Traditionalist claims highly specialised and arbitrary meanings for particular instances. On this basis, I render \u1e25alal here according to its proven, accepted, and general meaning.",239],[5,2,8,"8. Arabic: \u1e63adda + \u02bfan. See note to 8:47.",315],[5,2,9,"9.

Or within the span of. The Traditionalist typically renders the sense here as after a period [of suspension] of the messengers. I follow A. J. Arberry in my translation, and confine my reservations to the notes. I suggest the rendering above for the following reasons: the verb bayyana (announce, make clear) nowhere operates with the preposition \u02bfal\u0101, and the preposition seems to be hanging (the preposition \u02bfal\u0101 can have many meanings, to choose one at random given no association with a verb is simply to guess \u2014 and if the Traditionalist can guess then so can we all). Secondly, nowhere does the word after appear in the sentence \u2014 despite what translations typically presume, imply or insert. Nor does it say between anywhere in the sentence (some translators have it that there is an interval between the appearance of the messengers; but to read min as between in this single instance is a highly original treatment); the primary ways to render min al rusul are: of the messengers or among the messengers or from the messengers. Thirdly, the operative noun fatrah does \u2014 as the Traditionalist translators say \u2014 mean a period of time or interval or span of time. However, the text simply does not say between messengers, it says of or among messengers. Lastly, I return to the aforementioned hanging \u02bfal\u0101; by constructing the entire verse minus this one item I was able to choose of the many values available to that preposition with some degree of confidence in presenting my alternative reading above (see the beginning of 2:102 for an instance of comparable usage). In summary, I believe what is in view here is that Mu\u1e25ammad\u2019s ministry fell within that total span of time during which messengers came to men, not that it came after a lull in the appearance of messengers.",99],[5,20,1,"1. The Traditionalist, who has typically accepted uncritically the dominant Egypt-Palestine thesis and the Christian extension thereof, has historically experienced a twinge of awkwardness at this juncture, something which may be sampled by acquaintance with Muhammad Asad\u2019s attempt to ease those concerns: According to most of the commentators (e.g., Tabari, Zamakhshari, Razi), the \u201ckingship\u201d of the Israelites is a metaphorical allusion to their freedom and independence after their Egyptian bondage, the term \u201cking\u201d being equivalent here to \u201ca free man who is master of his own affairs\u201d (Manor VI, 323 f.) and can, therefore, adopt any way of life he chooses. The Traditionalist\u2019s problem \u2014 given prior acceptance of the dominant thesis listed above \u2014 is that, under that thesis, the children of Israel of the Hebrew scriptures had no kings under Moses; and the statement here at 5:20 brushes against the fur of the prevailing narratives found in the Hebrew scriptures. There exist alternative theses, however. Under the Arabia Felix thesis, for example, Fir\u02bfawn is simply a tribal king; moreover, the statements at 7:128-129 and then at 7:137 appear to serve the Arabia Felix thesis against the Egypt-Palestine thesis since the Qur\u2019an suggests \u2014 or appears to suggest \u2014 that the children of Israel inherited the land held by Fir\u02bfawn \u2014 a position which the Egypt-Palestine thesis cannot support. Given such a reading, as inheritors to Fir\u02bfawn, the children of Israel would indeed have been made kings in the lifetime of M\u016bs\u0101. There are, of course, other theses which interpret later prophecy in the Hebrew scriptures in terms of ethnic groups entirely distinct from the racial franchise we today call Jews (Black Hebrew Israelites, British Israelism, Christian Identity, etc.) but these are beyond the purview of this work. See Notepad XVI.",138],[5,21,1,"1. Under the Egypt-Palestine thesis this references Palestine.

As concerns those today called Jews, it is an inescapable fact that Jews are vastly disproportionately represented among those who may be termed \u2018committers of excess in the earth\u2019. Jews provided the intellectual justification, funding, and leadership for the Bolshevik revolution, for example; a killing operation which resulted, according to Solzhenitsyn, in sixty-six million deaths in the Soviet Union. One must add to that genocide those killed in World Wars I and II \u2014 horrors either largely created or, at the least, exacerbated by Jewish influence and interests \u2014 and the ongoing cultural war against both the German and all white peoples in particular, although against most other races and cultures as well, as well as against decency and morality in general. Robotic repetition of the assertion that one who understands such subjects is an anti-Semite (whatever that means) combined with endless outrage and threats of loss of career, position, and reputation have been an effective means of precluding any attempts at self-defence among those who have suffered \u2014 and continue to suffer \u2014 at the hands of representatives of this group. Personally, I see such actors on the stage of Life as a necessary component for the drama to unfold with the requisite breadth and contrast to make the choices each makes therein both authentic and valid. And the Qur\u2019anic position is clear: we are all going to God; the Judgment will stand; justice will be both righteous and eternal. And in that context, those Jews who have faith in God and the Hereafter and do good deeds have as much to look forward to in eternity as anyone else.",336],[5,33,1,"1. The \u2018reward\u2019 \u2014 or recompense \u2014 mentioned here points back, surely, to the statement which precedes the parenthesis: that \u2018it will be as if he killed mankind altogether\u2019 (and will, accordingly, be punished both in the World and in the Hereafter \u2014 a point made at the end of 5:33). The motif \u2018corruption in the land\u2019 occurs in varying contexts at both 5:32 and 5:33, tying these parts together as a single unit. The Traditionalist reads the passage which proceeds from the current point as a list of punishments to be meted out by him against those who withstand his militarised efforts to impose upon them a religion found nowhere in the Qur\u2019an. A more careful reading of the Qur\u2019an would have revealed to him the fact that the punishments listed here are associated exclusively in the text he claims as his foundational scripture with men in rebellion against God (\u2018kill [without right]\u2019: 2:61, 3:21, 17:33; \u2018they be crucified\u2019: cf. 4:157, 7:124, 12:41, 26:49; \u2018their hands and feet be cut off on alternate sides\u2019: cf. 7:124, 26:49; \u2018they be banished from the land\u2019: cf. 2:84-85, 7:82, 27:56). By imposing such punishments upon those who withstand his attempts to improve them, the Traditionalist aligns himself with those who form the subjects of the verses cited. See note to the present verse below.",10],[5,33,2,"2. Grammar: the four phrases which follow are not plain imperatives despite their treatment by translators.

That the two clauses following the dh\u0101lika statement are separate from it is confirmed by the reappearance of an equivalent statement comprising the same components but without dh\u0101lika below at 5:41 \u2014 which fact also serves to tie the broader narrative together.",252],[5,33,6,"6.

Famously, certain countries which call themselves Islamic lop off people\u2019s hands for instances of theft. Arguments are advanced by some in favour of to cut rather than to cut off in this context, with branding as the punishment, but I do not find the textual support required for it since it is the form I of the verb here (rather than form II such as we find at 12:31 and 12:50.) While I am temperamentally inclined to resist the Traditionalist\u2019s fascination with inflicting harm on others, having revisited this question I must concede that he is factually correct in this case: the bare, literal meaning is the operative one \u2014 but only within very clear parameters. The Traditionalist, again, makes here one of his commonest mistakes: he has entirely excluded the context. Beginning at 5:33, the context treats of war, of believers under military attack. And those who in such a context steal are either engaged in pillage or plunder or are the very worse kind of opportunists, people whose actions are not only reprehensible in themselves, but also place any military campaign in greater danger than already exists, and create further obstacles to achieving any future state of peace. In such conditions of extremis, wartime thieves are to be instantly punished in the firm and visible manner stated here, both as a punishment and as a deterrent. The context also ensures that those engaged only in the relatively lesser crime of theft in war \u2014 without having taken up arms against the believers \u2014 are not to be treated as enemy combatants (i.e. killed). According to this reading, chopping off people\u2019s hands in any other context is a crime for which the perpetrators will have to answer to God. Cf. 3:7, 12:75.",40],[5,38,2,"2.

Arabic: inj\u012bl \u2014 generally translated as Gospel based on the assertion that inj\u012bl is a corruption or abbreviation of \u03b5\u1f50\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, euang\u00e9lion or good news. I have followed this convention, but we need purchase on what is meant by the term. In the earliest account of the four versions Christians accept as canonical, Mark, Jesus preaches \u2018the gospel of the kingdom of God\u2019 (Mark 1:14). There is no further elucidation on the term gospel than that found in Mark. The word gospel occurs a total of eight times in Mark. In the next canonical account to be written, Matthew, Jesus is again preaching \u2018the gospel of the kingdom\u2019 (Matt. 4:23, 9:35). At 24:14 he is most emphatic: \u2018And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.\u2019 The word gospel occurs five times in Matthew. In the next canonical account to be written, Luke, Jesus adds no definition to his use of the word gospel; the term is used as though its sense is understood. The word gospel occurs four times in Luke. In the last canonical account to be written, John, the word gospel occurs nowhere. Thus, in those books claimed as canonical histories of Jesus by the Christians nowhere do we find any elucidation on the word gospel beyond the fact that it pertains to the kingdom of God. We note that the kingdom of God is something Jesus told his followers to pray for, since it forms a key part of the Lord\u2019s Prayer, and that the preaching of the kingdom of God is either a prerequisite for \u2014 or a signal of \u2014 the end of all things (Matt. 24:14). Of course, \u2018the kingdom of God\u2019 is not substantially what Christians mean by gospel, their core conception of gospel being singularly resistant to genuine identification with the words of Jesus. They have adopted Paul\u2019s gospel, and expend huge efforts and millions of dollars annually to preach that, and are surprised that the End does not come. (They are not alone in falling for such sleight of hand; Muslims are equally proof against considering their Book on its own terms, having long ago abandoned that endeavour in favour of later compositions and dogmas built thereupon.) What Christians in fact mean by gospel is, of course, a moving target. What, then, does the Qur\u2019an mean by inj\u012bl? We find a good example here at 5:46 which yields the facts that the inj\u012bl contains \u2018guidance and light\u2019 (which together) confirm what \u02bf\u012as\u0101 had access to of the Torah, and that it is \u2018guidance and admonition for those of prudent fear\u2019. A broader review of all contexts reveals the following: the inj\u012bl is mentioned at 3:3, 3:48, 3:65, 5:66, 5:68, 5:110 in one breath with the Torah \u2014 from which we deduce a high correlation between the two; at 7:157 we find something written (both in the Torah and the inj\u012bl) \u2014 from which we infer the inj\u012bl to be something written (either extant, or lost in whole or in part); at 9:111 God promises the believers the Garden in return for their lives and their wealth (as a promise binding upon God in the Torah and the inj\u012bl and the Qur\u2019an) \u2014 thus, like both the Torah and the Qur\u2019an, the inj\u012bl contains at its heart a commitment on the part of the believer to put the Hereafter before the present life; and at 48:29 the inj\u012bl is mentioned in relation to that parable which has survived to us as the parable of the mustard seed (which itself references the Kingdom of Heaven as an inner realm within a man which begins as something insignificant but grows to dominance within the soul and character until such point \u2014 in the Qur\u2019anic presentation \u2014 that the atheists are enraged) \u2014 thus, we identify for the inj\u012bl the characteristic of a potent but initially imperceptible force which, given right cultivation, may grow within the soul of a man to such a point that it supersedes previous concerns and comes to thwart attempts by atheists to quell or crush it; at 57:27 there is mention of the inj\u012bl as something given to \u02bf\u012as\u0101 and of compassion and mercy placed in the hearts of those who followed it (or, possibly, him). We need now a fuller understanding of what the Gospel means to Christians. Wikipedia tells us: In Christianity, the gospel (Greek: \u03b5\u1f50\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd euang\u00e9lion; Old English: gospel), or the Good News, is the news of the coming of the Kingdom of God (Mark 1:14-15), and of Jesus\u2019 death on the cross and resurrection to restore people\u2019s relationship with God. It may also include the descent of the Holy Spirit upon believers and the second coming of Jesus. This is a fair summary of what the majority of those who claim the Gospel today mean by the term, although most of it derives, as we have said, from Paul, not Jesus. We will now consider the components we have garnered from the Qur\u2019anic statements here and what we understand of the Christian position vis-\u00e0-vis the Gospel or inj\u012bl in sum to place before us all facets of what is meant by the term: 1. Some part of the Torah teachings (and confirmation thereof) or, at least, something related to the Torah. 2. A guidance and admonition for those of prudent fear. 3. A doctrine predicated upon the coming Kingdom of God; one which imbues the believer with increasing strength. 4. Something which is \u2014 or at least was \u2014 written down. 5. Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection as an act which reconciles man to God and forgives sin. 6. The descent of the Holy Spirit upon believers (understood to be an event auguring non-natural, supernatural or pseudo-supernatural abilities). 7. The Second Coming of Jesus (as the event marking the end of the Age). The Qur\u2019anic position is, then, that points 1, 2, 3 and 4 either represent \u2014 or, at least, comport with \u2014 what inj\u012bl means. Points 5, 6 and 7 either find no support in the Qur\u2019an or are directly repugnant to it. On the basis of the above, the working definition suggested here for what the Qur\u2019an means by inj\u012bl (Gospel) is: a Torah-related guidance given to \u02bf\u012as\u0101 orientated towards a reward in the Kingdom of Heaven found in written form and which increases the aspirant in piety. Under the Christian extension of the dominant Egypt-Palestine thesis the Qur\u2019an\u2019s presentation of \u02bf\u012as\u0101 is regarded exclusively in terms of a one-to-one correlation between \u02bf\u012as\u0101 and the Jesus of the 1st century CE. Both the \u02bfAs\u012br-\u1e24ej\u0101z and Arabia Felix theses begin from points which reject that assumption. I refer the interested reader to Notepad XVI and Notepad XVIII.

The Traditionalist assumes the Sharia to reference a holy and extensive legal system built substantively on the Qur\u2019an and only secondarily on the sayings and actions attributed to Mu\u1e25ammad (the most \u2018authoritative\u2019 compilations of which were written down by representatives of a nation with every reason to resent Arabs \u2014 namely, the Persians) centuries after Mu\u1e25ammad\u2019s death. The Orientalist for his part accepts this assessment, and the popular media bandies the same about in simplified form. The only problem with this cosy consensus is that the Qur\u2019an itself claims no such thing for shir\u02bfa, shar\u012b\u02bfa or any other word. Certainly, each of the peoples under monotheistic faiths has its own set of legal principles in the revelations which are the foundation of those religions \u2014 and this is the point being made here at 5:48. But there is no sense in which there exists a holy and specially sanctified legal system which should be imposed wholesale upon a people to make it \u2018Islamic\u2019 \u2014 at least no such concept exists in the Qur\u2019an. The notion of a single, universally correct \u2018Sharia\u2019 of any sort (in the popular sense in which I am now using the term) is refuted by the remainder of the verse. The only legal system to which the Qur\u2019an calls and enjoins upon the Messenger is identified both in this verse and the next as what God sent down. This can only refer, in the context of the Qur\u2019an, to that small number of verses which treats of legal matters and which provides the bones of a legal constitution, and to nothing more. The word shir\u02bfa occurs just once in the text, has no definite article and applies to a broad mass of humanity. The word shar\u012b\u02bfa occurs once at 45:18 and is a common noun with a primary or original sense of watering-place. The idea of an entire jurisprudence built on multiple sources (i.e. the Qur\u2019an and anything besides it) is nowhere found in the Qur\u2019anic revelation.",305],[5,48,9,"9.

J. Arberry\u2019s rendering, and which I consider most appropriate given the preponderance of similar contexts) I believe the allusion up to this point in the verse treats of the past but with an eye to the present. It is difficult for anyone to see past his indoctrination, and the Traditionalist is no exception; but the fact remains that the categories of men cited here pre-existed the Qur\u2019anic revelation, and 5:83-85 above specifically treat of righteous men among recipients of previous revelation. Additionally, stripped of its sectarian values, 5:86-92 can be seen as appealing to the broader reach of believers, not only to a particular sect called today Muslims. Not all translators see the text in the same light, however. With justification (given the liquid nature of tense in Classical Arabic), non-sectarian Arabist A. J. Arberry renders the whole verse in the present: There is no fault in those who believe and do deeds of righteousness what they may eat, if they are godfearing, and believe, and do deeds of righteousness, and then are godfearing and believe, and then are godfearing and do good; God loves the good-doers; staunch Traditionalists Hilali & Khan take a hybrid approach: Those who believe and do righteous good deeds, there is no sin on them for what they ate (in the past), if they fear Allah (by keeping away from His forbidden things), and believe and do righteous good deeds, and again fear Allah and believe, and once again fear Allah and do good deeds with Ihsan (perfection). And Allah loves the good-doers. Lastly, Traditionalist Saheeh International renders, like Hilali & Khan, to imply a cut-off for previous sins given a believing present: There is not upon those who believe and do righteousness [any] blame concerning what they have eaten [in the past] if they [now] fear All\u0101h and believe and do righteous deeds, and then fear All\u0101h and believe, and then fear All\u0101h and do good; and All\u0101h loves the doers of good.

While I concede most points to the Traditionalist in the translation in this and related sections, and confine my dissent to my notes, I need to add that occasionally translators render na\u02bfam here (sg. of an\u02bf\u0101m) sacrificial animals. Addition of sacrificial here is obvious deceit, as consideration of all 50 instances of the noun makes clear: 2:40, 2:47, 2:122, 2:150, 2:211, 2:231, 3:103, 3:103, 3:171, 3:174, 5:3, 5:6, 5:7, 5:11, 5:20, 5:110, 8:53, 12:6, 14:6, 14:28, 14:34, 16:18, 16:53, 16:71, 16:72, 16:81, 16:83, 16:112, 16:114, 16:121, 26:22, 27:19, 29:67, 31:20, 31:31, 33:9, 35:3, 37:57, 39:8, 39:49, 43:13, 46:15, 48:2, 49:8, 52:29, 54:35, 68:2, 68:49, 92:19, 93:11.",169],[5,95,4,"4. Arabic: hadya. See note to 2:196.",226],[5,95,5,"5. Arabic: balagha. This verb is used in the sense of to reach, to go as far as, to arrive either concerning time or space or in a metaphorical sense in its form I verb instances: 2:196, 2:231, 2:232, 2:234, 2:235, 3:40, 4:6, 6:19, 6:128, 6:152, 12:22, 13:14, 17:23, 17:34, 17:37, 18:60, 18:61, 18:76, 18:82, 18:86, 18:90, 18:93, 19:8, 22:5, 24:58, 24:59, 28:14, 33:10, 34:45, 37:102, 40:36, 40:67, 40:67, 40:80, 46:15, 46:15, 48:25, 56:83, 65:2, 75:26, its active participles: 5:95, 7:135, 13:14, 16:7, 40:56, 65:3, and as active participle adjectives: 6:149, 68:39. Here I take the collocation as meaning reaching (i.e. including the inspection of) the leg-joint. In this edition, I give the point to the Traditionalist in my translation, and confine my dissent to the notes. The broader question is entirely moot since al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m was closed to believers within the time of the revelation (see note to 9:28, and my book The God Protocol). All instances appear in the notes and reference this verse.",236],[5,95,6,"6. Arabic: ka\u02bfba. At 5:6 the word ka\u02bfba (in the dual) has the uncontested sense of ankles or leg-joints. The Traditionalist himself translates thus there. The word ka\u02bfba \u2014 admittedly ending with t\u0101\u02be marb\u016b\u1e6da (\u0629) occurs also at 5:95 and 5:97. Here, however, the Traditionalist claims \u2014 on the basis of no Qur\u2019anic evidence \u2014 that the value at these two locations is a box-shaped structure in Mecca to which one should prostrate himself. It is a quantum leap from the proven, known value of the word at 5:6 to what the Traditionalist claims for 5:95 and 5:97, and given that he expects one to practice on the basis of his claim what he himself would call idolatry did he himself not practice it, I think we should stop and consider the facts. Firstly, the verses at 5:95 and 5:97 are his primary points of purchase within the Qur\u2019an for his beloved structure at Mecca. Secondly, structures of this type were found all over Arabia, and have pagan origins (thus, the notion that his box is unique is erroneous). Thirdly, the Qur\u2019an contains multiple explicit warnings against worshipping anything but God, yet here the Traditionalist wishes one to ignore those and bow down to his box (cf. 3:7 and notes thereto). Naturally, I cannot prove on the basis of the Qur\u2019an that ka\u02bfba never meant what the Traditionalist claims for it, just as the Traditionalist cannot prove on the same basis that it did. What I can point to is the only explicit, clear value of a comparable word \u2014 one with which the Traditionalist agrees \u2014 and say that I accept that meaning. And on that basis, I incline towards an approximately equal value here also \u2014 not least because it makes sense. The scenario as I read it is this: an animal is killed when hunting is forbidden, the only remaining evidence of which is a corpse or skeleton. The condition of an animal may be ascertained by inspection of the leg-joints (lameness in animals being the primary threat to their economic viability \u2014 especially among nomadic or semi-nomadic peoples). In order to form their judgment, two just men should inspect the joints of the animal to ensure that what is given in payment is no worse than what was illegally killed. (This point was developed from an original insight by Aidid Safar to whom I am indebted here.) In this edition, I give the point to the Traditionalist in my translation, and confine my dissent to the notes. Were I to capitalise this word and remove italics, it would imply an endorsement for a sense which I refuse to allow into my work; accordingly, I simply transliterate the Arabic and leave the word italicised. The broader question is entirely moot since al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m was closed to believers within the time of the revelation (see note to 9:28, and my book The God Protocol). The instance at 5:97 appears in the notes and references this verse.",248],[5,95,7,"7. I.e. in the event that there is no proof or means to repay (see note above).",252],[5,95,8,"8.

This segment is so loaded with values which the Traditionalist bends to his requirements that it is tiresome to list them all. However, in the interests of thoroughness, we should note that this word also is hammered here into service on the basis of various agendas. The Traditionalist translators at Saheeh International render here: standing for the people (by which they mean standing as a sign confirming the Traditionalist\u2019s religion); Hilali & Khan have here: an asylum of security and Hajj and \u2018Umrah (pilgrimage) for mankind \u2014 for which rendering I can find little correlation in the text; to be charitable, we will assume it is a mistake on their part; A. J. Arberry has here: as an establishment for men; N. J. Dawood has: eternal values for mankind; and Muhammad Asad has: shall be a symbol for all mankind. Frankly, I don\u2019t think any of the translators cited could form a strong argument for their decision here. And nor can I. I follow Saheeh International in my translation since standing has a foundation in the broader text (3:18, 3:39, 3:75, 3:191, 4:5, 4:103, 5:97, 10:12, 11:100, 13:33, 22:26, 25:64, 39:9, 39:68, 51:45, 62:11, 70:33), though this does not imply agreement with their claims for the segment.

This form V verb in the active voice (as here) is consistently used in the Qur\u2019an with the sense of to die, or to take (i.e. to cause to die).

The Qur\u2019an is clear: God took \u02bf\u012as\u0101, son of Maryam (i.e. caused him to die). The narrative preferred by the Traditionalist in which \u02bf\u012as\u0101 ascends to God and is expected on the Day of Judgment has no foundation in the Qur\u2019an; it is, rather, based in the \u1e25adith literature and is a syncretic intrusion originating in Christian theological and eschatological notions. The Traditionalist\u2019s frequent rendering here of to raise or to take up (and synonyms) is a fudging of the facts \u2014 a workaround designed to bend the Qur\u2019an to a pre-existing ideology originating outside it.

The meaning of this verse is typically misunderstood \u2014 or simply not understood \u2014 by the Traditionalist, who considers the text either myopically, through the prism of his preferred literature, or not at all. However, the broader context \u2014 should we consider that \u2014 screams at us what is meant. In the preceding fifty-four verses we have met the imperative \u2018Say thou\u2019 a total of 17 times; by way of comparison, al baqarah \u2014 the longest chapter in the Qur\u2019an \u2014 contains 18 instances of this imperative in total. The present chapter contains in total 44 instances of \u2018Say thou\u2019 \u2014 more imperatives to the Messenger to speak than any other, and by a considerable margin. Surely, then, the meaning of this clause at 6:55 is that God sets out and details the proofs \u2018thus\u2019 by means of a series of imperatives comprising \u2018Say thou\u2019. Hence, the next clause points ahead to the following instances where \u2018Say thou\u2019 is present by means of which \u2018the path of the lawbreakers might be made manifest\u2019. The remainder of the chapter (interspersed with pertinent asides, narratives, summaries and law) represents a collection of set statements and preaching methodologies by means of which the Messenger \u2014 and we, the believers, by extension \u2014 can expose the way of the lawbreakers.

We can know that \u2018this\u2019 refers to the Qur\u2019an on the basis of pan-textual analysis focusing on the key term in the phrase: we sent (it) down (Arabic: anzaln\u0101hu) found in this statement. This element (anzaln\u0101hu) occurs at: 6:92, 6:155, 10:24*, 12:2, 13:37, 14:1, 17:105, 18:45*, 20:113, 21:50, 22:16, 38:29, 44:3, 97:1. The asterisks indicate verses which compare the life of the World to water sent down creating (temporary) growth, and emphasise God\u2019s ultimate mastery, thus representing a minor subset. All other instances either overtly reference the Qur\u2019anic revelation, or can be shown to reference it on a pan-textual basis.

By way of confirmation, the broadly Traditionalist Muhammad Asad translates here (though a little more expansively than do I) both correctly and honestly: And whomsoever God wills to guide, his bosom He opens wide with willingness towards self-surrender [unto Him]. Not all translators are so honest. And, clearly, this word is employed by both the ignorant and the deceitful as though its Qur\u2019anic usage signalled a religion comprising the myriad dogmas created by men subsequent to the Qur\u2019anic revelation and called today by the catch-all term \u2018Islam\u2019. The absence of Qur\u2019anic support for this assertion will be grasped once isl\u0101m and other derivatives of the same root across the broader Qur\u2019anic text are taken into account. Additionally, the reader would do well to consider the surrounding context: what leads up to 6:125 (and much of what follows) describes those who insinuate themselves and their lies into the business of serving God, and attempt to overturn what God himself revealed. The entire point is that God \u2014 not a \u2018religion\u2019 \u2014 guides. See 3:18-19 and notes thereto.",70],[6,125,2,"2. Arabic: l\u0101 yu\u2019min\u016bn.

This form X verb with an object in min means: to desire or to wish for much (of a thing). An example Lane gives (p. 2651) is: He desired of him for himself much of the water that he might drink it. The second meaning Lane gives is to reckon something much, abundant or many. Before considering which of these options is more likely, we will look at how this collocation is typically rendered. We will remember, of course, that historically Muslims have conflated a number of Qur\u2019anic conventions, considering them all to mean non-human entities, generally called Jinn. This subject is unpicked at Article SJC. The salient point for us here is that al jinn means dominant human beings (rendered here by the Latin term domini), and that it is this dominant minority which rules the affairs of men. But it is natural that translations should be directed by understanding and, historically, the understanding of al jinn has been that summarised above. Accordingly, N. J. Dawood renders here: He will say: \u2018Jinn, you have seduced mankind in great numbers.\u2019 A. J. Arberry has: \u2018Company of jinn, you have made much of mankind.\u2019 Saheeh International has: \u201cO company of jinn, you have [misled] many of mankind.\u201d Muhammad Asad, ever expansive, has: \u201cO you who have lived in close communion with [evil] invisible beings! A great many [other] human beings have you ensnared!\u201d And Hilali & Khan have: \u201cO you assembly of jinns! Many did you mislead of men\u201d. The common denominator here is the notion of much \u2014 which is the core sense of the verb root; beyond that, the translators have embellished on the basis of their understanding. The plain senses provided by Lane do not suit them because they do not fit with the notion of non-human entities. But if al jinn means simply that coterie of dominant men (the domini) which directs the masses (the servi), then the psychological resistance to a plain reading falls away. There remains only the question of which of the two senses Lane provides is more likely, and given the context \u2014 an address to the rulers concerning the ruled \u2014 the more likely case is the one I have used.",91],[6,128,3,"3. Arabic: al ins. See Article SJC.",110],[6,128,4,"4. It is an interesting point \u2014 one easily elided in reading \u2014 that the domini have allies (helpers, protectors) from among the servi. It is a fact that the ruling elite operate through a network of organisations (military, scientific, educational, media, financial, religious, etc.) which they use as their tools of control. The men at the top of those structures are the house Negroes as it were of the plantation masters. For an archetypal example see 7:113-114.",128],[6,128,5,"5. Arabic: al ins.

I accept that farsh has the meaning of slaughter also (since slaughter is a necessary step in the process of obtaining skin \u2014 something upon which one lies \u2014 that is likely the connection). My instinct always is to stay with what has a genuine basis in Qur\u2019anic usage, and have rendered accordingly.

The serious student of the Qur\u2019an should understand that this type of bait-and-switch is typical of the Traditionalist\u2019s treatment of the Qur\u2019an: his job is to impose his religion upon the text no matter what the words say or mean.

While I neither share Muhammad Asad\u2019s confidence that the \u1e25ad\u012bth literature corresponds in any meaningful way to actual history nor accept uncritically his assumption that \u02bf\u012as\u0101 and Jesus are necessarily the same person, his comments here are insightful and valuable and repeated in full: Lit., \u201cuntil (hatta) a twisted rope passes through a needle\u2019s eye\u201d; since this phrase is meant to express an impossibility, the rendering of hatta as \u201cany more than\u201d seems to be appropriate here. As for the word jamal occurring in this sentence, there is hardly any doubt that its translation, in this context, as \u201ccamel\u201d is erroneous. As pointed out by Zamakhshari (and confirmed by other classical commentators, including Razi), Ibn \u2019Abbas used to read the word in the spelling jummal, which signifies \u201ca thick rope\u201d or \u201ca twisted cable\u201d; and the same reading is attributed to \u2019Ali ibn Abi Talib (Taj al-\u2019Arus). It is to be noted that there are also several other dialectical spellings of this word, namely, jumal, juml, jumul and, finally, jamal (as in the generally-accepted version of the Qur\u2019an) - all of them signifying \u201ca thick, twisted rope\u201d (Jawhari), and all of them used in this sense by some of the Prophet\u2019s Companions or their immediate successors (tabi\u2019un). Ibn \u2019Abbas is also quoted by Zamakhshari as having said that God could not have coined so inappropriate a metaphor as \u201ca camel passing through a needle\u2019s eye\u201d - meaning that there is no relationship whatever between a camel and a needle\u2019s eye whereas, on the other hand, there is a definite relationship between the latter and a rope (which, after all, is but an extremely thick thread). On all accounts, therefore, the rendering of jamal as \u201ca twisted rope\u201d is, in this context, infinitely preferable to that of \u201ca camel\u201d. The fact that the latter rendering occurs in a somewhat similar phrase in the Greek version of the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew xix, 24, Mark x, 25 and Luke xviii, 25) does not affect this contention. One should remember that the Gospels were originally composed in Aramaic, the language of Palestine at the time of Jesus, and that those Aramaic texts are now lost. It is more than probable that, owing to the customary absence of vowel signs in Aramaic writing, the Greek translator misunderstood the consonant spelling g-m-l (corresponding to the Arabic j-m-l), and took it to mean \u201ca camel\u201d: a mistake repeated since, with regard to the above Qur\u2019anic verse, by many Muslims and all, non-Muslim orientalists as well.",158],[7,41,1,"1.

The Traditionalist view is that the expression al nab\u012b al ummiyy (the unschooled or heathen prophet) is an epithet used exclusively for the Prophet Mu\u1e25ammad. I do not agree with that view, and these are my reasons: from 7:103 to this point (over 50 verses), the narrative is focused solely on the history of M\u016bs\u0101. M\u016bs\u0101 was not schooled in the Writ; rather, he received the Writ by means of revelation. Under the dominant Egypt-Palestine thesis, he was brought up as an Egyptian; under the Arabia Felix and \u02bfAs\u012br-\u1e24ej\u0101z theses, he was brought up in the house of a tribal chief named Fir\u02bfawn. In any event, by the standard we use here to judge ummiyy (i.e. one outside or ignorant of the Writ) M\u016bs\u0101 was \u2014 at least until he received the Writ \u2014 fully ummiyy. The expression al nab\u012b al ummiyy (the unschooled or heathen prophet) occurs just twice in the Qur\u2019an \u2014 here and in the next verse. Due to his disproportionate emphasis on Mu\u1e25ammad, the Traditionalist, in my opinion, has missed the point being made here. The point is not that Mu\u1e25ammad was unlearned and therefore the Qur\u2019an is all the more a miracle (which is the version the Traditionalist promulgates); it is that M\u016bs\u0101 was unschooled in the Writ and so was Mu\u1e25ammad. The Traditionalist view places the narrative pivot after the long account of M\u016bs\u0101 here at 7:157. But it is simply not there. It comes in the next verse (Say thou[...]). Logically speaking, at 7:157 the person being described is the same individual the previous 53 verses were dedicated to; namely: M\u016bs\u0101. It is M\u016bs\u0101 who is [...]the unschooled prophet \u2014 whom they find written with them in the Torah and the Gospel[...] (to the end of the verse). It is only at 7:158 that the narrative shifts to Mu\u1e25ammad. The point of this device, in my opinion, is to establish a correlation between the first unschooled prophet M\u016bs\u0101 (who brought his people out of bondage and gave them a Writ) and Mu\u1e25ammad who had a comparable mission for the whole of humanity. Having established this correlation, the narrative then returns to the story of M\u016bs\u0101.",62],[7,157,3,"3. At this juncture the Traditionalist often points at Deut. 18:15 which reads: The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken. Since they typically have a grasp on the Hebrew scriptures no broader than this single verse, the Traditionalist\u2019s students are impressed. What they probably don\u2019t know is that Christians also claim this verse for Jesus. And what they almost certainly don\u2019t know is that, were one to read the Torah free of the later claims made against it by Muslims and Christians, Deut. 18:15 comports most convincingly with neither Jesus nor Mu\u1e25ammad, but with M\u016bs\u0101\u2019s immediate successor, Joshua.

Pursuant to the notes to the present verse treating of M\u016bs\u0101: it is a fact that the personality of M\u016bs\u0101 is found in those accounts of the life of Jesus which the Christian holds as canonical. The Traditionalist, predictably, tries to insert Mu\u1e25ammad into the Christians\u2019 text, and he does so by means of inventive claims around the word paraclete as found at John 14:14-17. However, those claims have both linguistic and contextual problems and do not stand up to scrutiny. The Traditionalist makes additional, related claims on the basis of the word a\u1e25mad at 61:6 (see that verse and note thereto).",121],[7,157,5,"5. Arabic: ma\u02bfr\u016bf.

Thus, used as a participle, it means \u201cone who has gained insight [into something] through persistent inquiry\u201d.

To the Traditionalist the passage following treats of calling to false deities and the futility thereof. I disagree; rather, it comprises a taut argument and template for calling people to guidance. His confusion on this point arises due to a characteristic of Arabic usage. The verb to call in Arabic means both to summon and to supplicate. (In addition, where the verb is found with il\u0101 the sense is to invite to, and I render thus throughout.) This in some part explains the Traditionalist\u2019s reading of 7:194 which he takes to be a challenge to the idolaters to supplicate to their false gods. It is, rather, an exhortation to the believers to invite others to guidance. The stages in the formula are: 1. invite them; 2. let them respond; 3. challenge them to do their worst while stating one\u2019s own faith in God and his Writ as one\u2019s only defence (i.e. to lay down the gauntlet). The emphasis is on putting one\u2019s faith in God alone; in cutting ties with \u2014 and realising the futility of trusting in \u2014 anything other than God.

Qur\u2019anic definition: (al) mu\u2019min\u016bn (sg.: mu\u2019min) (\u1e25aqqan) \u2014 the believers (in truth). The term al mu\u2019min\u016bn is generally translated (which convention I follow) as the believers. The problem with the idea of belief in English is that it can be associated either with gullibility or with opinion based upon nothing concrete, or it invites the assumption that one who has it has something which defies any analysis. Happily, we have the Qur\u2019an\u2019s definition of the term by which a believer \u2014 more specifically \u2018a believer in truth\u2019 \u2014 can identify himself as such to himself on the basis of set criteria as straightforwardly as can a mechanic or a nurse. Such people, then, have certain qualities: 1. Their hearts fear when God is remembered 2. The reading of God\u2019s proofs (i.e. scripture) increases them in faith 3. They place their trust in God 4. They uphold the duty (to serve him alone, seek help from him alone, and obey his laws) 5. They spend out of what God gives them. The second half of this definition is found at 8:74 and it comprises: 6. Those who believe 7. Those who emigrate 8. Those who strive in the cause of God 9. Those who give shelter 10. Those who help. Thus the equation is quite simple. If a man has qualities 1 through 10 he is a believer in truth. This indicates that there are believers other than those who are believers in truth (as the segment 8:1-14 indicates, since \u2014 despite the fact that this insight has eluded the Traditionalist \u2014 al k\u0101fir\u016bn is a group which attaches itself to the believers, and found more generally inside the gate than outside it). However, if a man has none of these qualities (or is deficient in one or more of them) and has no desire to acquire them, he may be many things but a believer in truth is not one of them. It will be noted that the qualities which define a believer are not dependent upon (and in fact require no mention of) a religion of any stripe.

A difficulty in understanding this verb is due to the fact that it has two related applications. It can mean to divert (e.g. a person turns away another person from something). But it can also mean to forsake (e.g. a person himself turns away from something). For more on this ambiguity in the Arabic see Lane (p. 1668) where we find that the preposition \u02bfan offers nothing by way of concrete guidance. The Traditionalist typically renders in both senses but without any discernible system. My own understanding is: where there exists a human object I regard the verb in its first application (e.g. he diverts his friend from the road); where there is no human object I see the verb its second application (e.g. he forsakes the road). This approach fits all contexts and requires none of the interpolation which typifies Traditionalist translations, which is why I believe it to be correct.

Muhammad Asad provides a helpful comment here: Some of the commentators see in this verse a divine prediction, thus: \u201cIf there be twenty of you .... they shall overcome two hundred ...\u201d, etc. Since, however, history shows that the believers, even at the time of the Prophet, were not always victorious against such odds, the above view is not tenable. In order to understand this passage correctly, we must read it in close conjunction with the opening sentence, \u201cInspire the believers to conquer all fear of death\u201d, whereupon we arrive at the meaning given in my rendering: namely, an exhortation to the believers to conquer all fear of death and to be so patient in adversity that they might be able to overcome an enemy many times their number (Razi: see also Manar X, 87). The concluding words of this verse --because they are people who cannot grasp it [i.e. the truth]\u201d - can be understood in either of two ways: (a) as giving an additional reason of the true believers\u2019 superiority over \u201cthose who are bent on denying the truth\u201d (alladhina kafaru), inasmuch as the latter, not believing in the eternal verities and in life after death cannot rise to that enthusiasm and readiness for self-sacrifice which distinguishes the true believers: or (b) as explaining that \u201cthose who are bent on denying the truth\u201d deny it simply because their spiritual deafness and blindness prevents them from grasping it. To my mind, the second of these two interpretations is preferable, and particularly so in view of the fact that the Qur\u2019an often explains in these terms the attitude of \u201cthose who deny the truth\u201d (e.g., in 6:25, 7:179, 9:87, etc.).",247],[8,66,1,"1.

This is a crucial point in the Traditionalist\u2019s presentation, and by reviewing the translation of the present clause by the staunchly Traditionalist Hilali & Khan, we can understand quite how crucial it is; it reads as follows: (and) if you (Muslims of the whole world collectively) do not do so (i.e. become allies, as one united block with one Khalifah - chief Muslim ruler for the whole Muslim world to make victorious Allah\u2019s Religion of Islamic Monotheism). By his own lights, only six of these words are in the text. And to have any sort of scriptural justification, his reading requires that the following be found in the Qur\u2019an: 1. \u2018Allah\u2019s Religion of Islamic Monotheism\u2019 as intoned by the Traditionalist; 2. an instruction to have a single king (\u2018Khalifah - chief Muslim ruler for the whole Muslim world\u2019); 3. an instruction to make \u2018Allah\u2019s Religion of Islamic Monotheism\u2019 binding upon others. But none of this is in the Qur\u2019an, and can only be made to seem to be in it given much deceit on the part of the Traditionalist teacher, and much ignorance of the Qur\u2019an on the part of his student. These values are entirely the product of the Traditionalist\u2019s own efforts, and are imported into the Qur\u2019an as assumed conclusions, ones which defy objective analysis in that context. And in those recent cases where he has managed to apply his psychosis on people as a political reality, no one has wanted to live in the result \u2014 not even the Traditionalist himself. He has been much happier to move to nominally Christian countries, and to avail himself of their generosity, tolerance, and fascination with promoting anything which is inimical to their own interests. The Traditionalist\u2019s understanding then, is proven not to work. That could mean that the Qur\u2019an is wrong; or it could mean that the Traditionalist simply does not understand the Qur\u2019an. Certainly, the Traditionalist has failed to grasp the core thread which runs through the Qur\u2019an of warning; any military or society-building efforts \u2014 at least according to the Qur\u2019an \u2014 coming only subsequent to that.

The Traditionalist assigns the instance here at 9:25 the value of a proper noun (that of a name he claims for a specific valley near Mecca which he asserts as the name of the precise location of the battle described here). The attentive reader will have noted the Traditionalist\u2019s habit of claiming implausible levels of specificity \u2014 ones which defy any sort of verification on the basis of the Qur\u2019anic data \u2014 which tend towards a single end: to make him and his preferred literature the arbiter in the reading of God\u2019s revelation. Mecca as the locus for any portion of the Qur\u2019anic narrative is here rejected (see Notepad XVI and note to 9:28 as well as my book The God Protocol), so claims for a location of any kind in that vicinity may be safely ignored. The \u1e25-n-n root covers senses of longing, yearning, nostalgia, craving, desire. A plausible sense is \u2014 given a marking of \u1e25anayn rather than \u1e25unayn \u2014 is, perhaps, (two) desires; meanwhile, Lane (p. 657) notes that the Arabs called a particular month \u1e25unayn (cf. rama\u1e0d\u0101n at 2:185). Since I cannot prove either case definitively, I have elected to leave the word untranslated, and to capitalise it (thereby treating it as a proper noun, and conceding the point to the Traditionalist in my translation). While I do not accept any of what Muhammad Asad writes here, I include it for the broader understanding of the interested student: The battle of Hunayn, a valley situated on one of the roads leading from Mecca to Ta\u2019if, took place in the year 8 H., shortly after the conquest of Mecca by the Muslims. The latters\u2019 opponents were the pagan tribes of Hawazin (in whose territory the valley lay) and their allies, the Band Thaqif. The Muslim army - reinforced by many newly-converted Meccans - comprised about twelve thousand men, whereas the Hawazin and Thaqif had only one-third of that number at their disposal. Relying on their great numerical superiority, the Muslims were over-confident and, apparently, careless. In the narrow defiles beyond the oasis of Hunayn they fell into an ambush prepared by the tribesmen and began to retreat in disorder after heavy losses had been inflicted on them by the bedouin archers. It was only the example of the Prophet and his early adherents (the Meccan muhajirun and the ansar from Medina) that saved the day and turned the initial rout of the Muslims into a decisive victory. It is to this battle that verses 25 and 26 refer, pointing out that true succour can come only from God, and that great numbers, ties of kinship and worldly wealth are of no avail if they are \u201cdearer to you than God and His Apostle and the struggle in His cause\u201d (see preceding verse). As usual, the broader question is entirely moot since al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m was closed to believers within the time of the revelation (see note to 9:28, and my book The God Protocol).",61],[9,26,1,"1.

It is my understanding that this refers to the undesirable turn of events outlined at 9:25, a view which is supported at 9:27 also.

Typically read So let them not approach, the textual justification for reading l\u0101 taqrab\u016b rather than l\u0101 yaqrab\u016b follows. The Traditionalist\u2019s reading of this verse (provided here by Saheeh International, which is typical) is as: O you who have believed, indeed the polytheists are unclean, so let them not approach al-Masjid al-\u1e24ar\u0101m after this, their [final] year. And if you fear privation, All\u0101h will enrich you from His bounty if He wills. Indeed, All\u0101h is Knowing and Wise. The underlined portion of the verse above indicates that part of the text which is rendered by the form I verb qaraba \u2014 to approach, draw near. There are 11 instances of the form I of this verb in the Qur\u2019an (2:35, 2:187, 2:222, 4:43, 6:151, 6:152, 7:19, 9:28, 12:60, 17:32, 17:34). All instances are preceded by the negative particle l\u0101. In 10 of the 11 instances we find qaraba + l\u0101 + the jussive mood, and one case (12:60) l\u0101 is followed by the imperfective. In all cases it provides a direct warning against approaching something or, as in the case of 12:60, provides a statement of limitation of access to something. The verse at 9:28 is immediately conspicuous because only here has the Traditionalist pointed the text not in the second person (approach you not), but in the third person (let them not approach) \u2014 the difference here being merely that of placing two dots below the stem rather than above it \u2014 such dots not being intrinsic to the text in any case. However, this pointing of the verb here at 9:28 \u2014 one which is conspicuously anomalous across all other instances of this verb \u2014 requires that we accept a form of imperative in this single instance found nowhere else in the text. The force which is imputed to this word by the Traditionalist\u2019s reading is \u2018let them not approach\u2019. This type of exhortation certainly exists in the Qur\u2019an (e.g. \u2018let not such-and-such think that[...]\u2019). But this convention, where it occurs \u2014 and especially where it appeals to a third-person plural subject \u2014 is a rhetorical device, and operates as an exhortation, or as strong advice. (Consider, for example, 51:59 \u2014 \u2018so let them not seek to hasten Me!\u2019) It nowhere operates as a literal imperative (there is no expectation that the hearer will literally prevent such-and-such from thinking anything whatever \u2014 although it is recommended that they comply). But at 9:28, the Traditionalist\u2019s pointing of this one word requires that we accept a form of imperative found nowhere else in the Qur\u2019an: it requires that the reader take this rhetorical construction directed to a third-person plural subject as a binding, literal imperative upon himself. In summary, in order for the Traditionalist\u2019s pointing of this word to be valid, it requires \u2014 in this single instance \u2014 firstly, that we allow that, while all remaining instances of this verb are negative constructions which treat of second-person subjects, here it does so with a third-person subject; and secondly, that \u2014 in a case unique to the entire Qur\u2019an \u2014 a negative jussive exhortation treating of a third-person plural subject has a literal imperative force binding upon the hearer. I do not accept this as a rational or reasonable position. The case I accept, is that this word is as I have translated it \u2014 \u2018approach not\u2019 \u2014 which reading does not require aberrant handling of the verb under discussion (given an otherwise uniform set across the Qur\u2019an), and does not require that we impose upon the Qur\u2019an a uniquely anomalous instance of a rhetorical device as a literal, binding imperative. During the final editing phase of this work, I was sent an objection to this thesis which, despite the objection\u2019s obvious weaknesses, I will address here. The critic (who referenced his own fluency in Arabic in support of his argument) asserted that the verb cannot refer to the believers since God addresses the believers directly in the beginning of the verse (the idea being that some sort of tautology results when an address to a particular party is followed directly by an imperative to the same party). However, the Qur\u2019an is full of such constructions (9:23 and 9:119 being merely two which are close to hand). Additionally, the critic\u2019s point is not only incorrect in its assertion, it is also at least partly wrong in its premise, since the verb at 9:28 as read by him implies an imperative to those addressed in any case for who is to prevent \u2018those who ascribe a partnership\u2019 from approaching \u2018the inviolable place of worship\u2019 if not those addressed in the verse?",86],[9,28,4,"4.

Its purpose was as a platform from which the Messenger and the believers were to deliver the message of repentance to the One God; it was not to form a centre of \u2018religion\u2019.

In other words, the above injunction to fight is relevant only in the event of aggression committed against the Muslim community or state, or in the presence of an unmistakable threat to its security: a view which has been shared by that great Islamic thinker, Muhammad \u2019Abduh. Commenting on this verse, he declared: \u201cFighting has been made obligatory in Islam only for the sake of defending the truth and its followers...

This verse often provokes howls from Jews who claim that they have never treated any man in such fashion.

Seen in that light, at 9:30 the specialness which Christians and Rabbinic Jews claim generically for themselves is crystallised in the persons of the messiah and \u02bfUzayr respectively (Ezra being a man religious Jews revere for \u2018restoring\u2019 the Torah).

Apart from the explicit sense which is that God has set the number of months (i.e. in a year), this also, perhaps, implies that we should be aware that God knows how many have passed and how many yet to come. A month is also a convenient unit by which man can plan, develop, and grow; once we become attuned to the phases of the moon, we gain a deeper relationship with time, becoming aware at the end of each month that this block of time is now forever gone: the good and the evil thereof are, as it were, stored away (or amassed, to echo the preceding verse). However, this statement has another \u2014 and verifiable \u2014 significance, for which see Notepad XX.",33],[9,36,3,"3. Arabic: shahr \u2014 moon, month.

My view is that this feminine object pronoun agrees with count (\u02bfidda); however, it is claimed by the Traditionalist to reference four months. Even given the Traditionalist\u2019s reading, mention of idolaters later in the verse suggests a statement referencing 9:2; this would imply a particular pledge covering four months with particular idolaters in a particular year; certainly, there is no sense at 9:2 that the pledge mentioned there should hold up for all time \u2014 not even the Traditionalist claims that. The Traditionalist, however, somewhat predictably, claims a value here of four particular months with an import extending beyond the local context, the details of which he claims to know.

My view (which happened to agree in part with the assertions of some Traditionalists, though for reasons other than those which they provide) was that this statement indicates the postponement of months in order to make the lunar calendar concur with the solar calendar.

I understand this verse (and by implication those following) at an oblique angle to the Traditionalist. For him, the Messenger is chided here for granting leave not to join the campaign. Saheeh International, for example, has it: [...]why did you give them permission [to remain behind]? [You should not have] until it was evident to you who were truthful and you knew [who were] the liars. The chiding tone which the Traditionalist correctly detects is actuated by a concern opposite to the one he assumes. The point is that the Messenger had granted leave to join the campaign to unworthy men. The focus of the passage is not to prevent those who wish to opt out from doing so. It is to get rid of such people as quickly as possible and prevent them from joining, but to do so on the basis of proper criteria \u2014 which is itself a practice with Qur\u2019anic precedent (see 2:249-250). The attentive reader will find this position fully supported by the verses which follow, and confirmed emphatically at 9:83.",46],[9,44,1,"1.

I take this to mean that the speakers are referring to what has preceded in the Qur\u2019anic text; namely, the fact that they were told not to participate (cf. 9:43-48), and thus had no part in the outcome.

Meanwhile, Muhammad Asad \u2014 drawing on a non-Qur\u2019anic literature for much of his point \u2014 comments here: I.e., in the course of the expedition to Tabuk, during which most of this surah was revealed.

While I do not accept all the narrative specifics, the core of Muhammad Asad\u2019s point here is valuable enough to warrant reproducing his note here in full: Lit., \u201cwhat God has given them, and His Apostle\u201d: a typically Qur\u2019anic construction meant to bring out the fact that the real giver is God, and that the Apostle is His instrument. Although this passage relates, primarily, to the hypocrites at Medina and the historical situation obtaining at the time of the expedition to Tabuk, the import of these verses goes beyond the historical occasion of their revelation, describing as it does \u201cthe attitude and mentality of hypocrites of all times, and everywhere\u201d (Manor X, 567). Consequently, we may assume that the reference, in this context, to \u201cGod\u2019s Apostle\u201d is not confined to the person of the Prophet Muhammad but implies, metonymically, the Law of Islam as revealed through him - and, thus, to every government that holds authority by virtue of that Law and rules in accordance with it.",162],[9,59,3,"3. Sc. it would have been the better for them.",198],[9,60,1,"1. Here the text is inconvenient to the Traditionalist\u2019s agenda. The word is \u1e63adaq\u0101t (lit.: charities). However, the Traditionalist is heavily invested in his externally derived requirement of a percentage-based material payment (tax) which he claims is the meaning of zak\u0101t (for why this is Qur\u2019anically unsustainable see Article SZC). But the word here is not zak\u0101t, it is \u1e63adaq\u0101t. The non-sectarians render correctly, N. J. Dawood as alms and A. J. Arberry as freewill offerings. However, the Traditionalist translators unblushingly twist the text into conformity with their requirements: Saheeh International renders the opening as: Zak\u0101h expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy it and provides a footnote stating: By the state to collect, guard and distribute the zak\u0101h. Meanwhile, Hilali & Khan have: As-Sadaqat (here it means Zakat) are only for the Fuqara\u2019 (poor).",7],[9,60,2,"2. Lit.: on.",64],[9,60,3,"3.

See Notepad X.",240],[9,62,1,"1. Arabic: a\u1e25aqq-. See Notepad XVII.",76],[9,62,2,"2. The object pronoun here is the masculine singular (Arabic: hu), and not the dual or plural; the only honest choice in translation here is between him or Him. This is inconvenient to the Traditionalist; his stock-in-trade is conflating the recipient of the Qur\u2019an with someone called Mu\u1e25ammad who features prominently in a much later literature \u2014 one which Mu\u1e25ammad never saw or sanctioned \u2014 and his purpose is to convince one that expressions which reference God\u2019s messenger in the Qur\u2019an have as their object following this later literature (or, more precisely, the Traditionalist\u2019s explanation of it). Thus, he needs this phrase to support that outcome; but, irritatingly for him, it does not. Traditionalist translators do a dance around the grammar to achieve their object, with Saheeh International rendering: But All\u0101h and His Messenger are more worthy for them to satisfy, if they should be believers, and Traditionalist translators Hilali & Khan rendering: but it is more fitting that they should please Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad SAW), if they are believers. This is dishonest treatment of the text. For comparison, the non-sectarian A. J. Arberry renders according to the words on the page: more right is it they should please Him, if they are believers. However, not all Traditionalists are cut from one cloth, and I include Muhammad Asad\u2019s note to this verse in full: Lit., \u201cthe while God and His Apostle are most entitled that they should seek His pleasure...\u201d, etc. As has been pointed out by many of the commentators (and most succinctly by Rashid Rida\u2019 in Manar X, 607 f.), there is no question of any juxtaposition of God and His Apostle in this phrase. This is made clear by the use of the singular pronoun in an yurduhu (\u201cthat they should seek His pleasure\u201d), which is meant to bring out - in the inimitable elliptic form so characteristic of the Qur\u2019an - the idea that God\u2019s pleasure is the only worthwhile goal of all human endeavour, and that a believer\u2019s duty to surrender to the Prophet\u2019s guidance is but an outcome of the fact that he is the bearer of God\u2019s message to man. Cf. in this connection, \u201cWhoever pays heed unto the Apostle pays heed unto God thereby\u201d (4:80), or, \u201cSay [O Prophet]: \u2018If you love God, follow me, [and] God will love you\u2019\u201d (3:31).",112],[9,62,3,"3.

Here the context indicates specifically the duty to treat appropriately those whose loyalty and commitment was previously in question but who then repented and contributed to the cause. The Traditionalist claims a value here of prayer (i.e. that the Messenger prayed for such people). What the Traditionalist means by prayer wanders depending on what he wants to achieve. Here what he means by prayer is personal supplication or intercessory appeal to God. In other positions what he means is a highly ritualised process of liturgy and physical movements held to be beneficial to the practitioner and required by God (a process in which personal supplication or intercessory appeal to God may or may not feature). The speaker of English does not generally notice that a single English word is being applied by the Traditionalist so as to conflate two entirely different concepts. However, what is always the case \u2014 and what can be demonstrated on the basis of the Qur\u2019anic text and the consistent usage therein \u2014 is that \u1e63al\u0101t denotes duty, a fact which remains true no matter what specific value the Traditionalist claims for it in this or any other case.

The term \u201cthose who deny the truth\u201d refers, in this context, specifically to people who a priori reject the notion of divine revelation and, thus, of prophethood.

However, I have been guided to a large degree by Muhammad Asad, who notes here: The primary meaning of the verb asarrahu is \u201che concealed it\u201d or \u201che kept it secret\u201d; thus, the phrase asarru \u2018n-nadamah (expressed in the past tense but in the above context obviously denoting a future event) could be rendered as \u201cthey will conceal their remorse\u201d. In view, however, of the many statements in the Qur\u2019an that on the Day of Judgment the sinners will not only not conceal but will, rather, stress their remorse, some of the commentators (e.g., Baghawi, on the authority of Abu \u2018Ubaydah) are of the opinion that in this particular verse the verb asarra denotes the opposite of its primary meaning and, accordingly, interpret the phrase as \u201cthey will manifest their remorse\u201d. But the linguistic validity of this rather forced interpretation has been emphatically contested by many philologists, and particularly by Abu Mansur al-Azhari (cf. Lane IV, 1337); and since there is no convincing reason to disregard the original significance of the verb asarra with its implication of \u201cconcealment\u201d, the above Qur\u2019anic phrase must be understood (as Zamakhshari understands it), in the metonymical sense of an involuntary \u201cconcealment\u201d, that is, the sinners\u2019 inability to express the full depth of their remorse.",134],[10,54,3,"3.

Arabic: qiblah. See note to 2:142. The verse here at 10:87 is the only scenario in which qiblah occurs outside of 2:142 and repetitions thereof at 2:143-145. It is physically impossible for qiblah to mean at 10:87 what the Traditionalist requires it to mean at 2:142 (namely, a place towards which one turns in prayer). His awareness of a dissonance with his required value at 2:142-145 is revealed here if we look at his attempts to paper over the cracks of his problem in the present context. Saheeh International has here: and make your houses [facing the] qiblah. The words in square brackets are imagined to exist by the translators; they are not in the text. Hilali & Khan sidestep this problem by other means: and make your dwellings as places for your worship. This is a stretch, but to the inattentive reader may seem close enough. But is \u2018place(s) for your worship\u2019 what they understand by qiblah at 2:142-145? Of course not. In both cases, we discern subterfuge. And this sleight of hand persists also in the minds of those who read in Arabic because the priests of the religion of Islam correctly understand that they can rely upon those who follow them to exercise little or no intellectual rigour. However, if we look to a non-specialised, \u2018unmullahised\u2019 meaning of this word (such as destination or course), we find that it fits both scenarios perfectly. The only remaining problem is one for the Traditionalist, in that this plain meaning does not meet his cultic requirements. Additionally, while some claim that the local narrative at 10:87 refers to the night of the Passover, close analysis proves that the Passover is in no way corroborated by the Qur\u2019an. The number of signs given M\u016bs\u0101 is nine (17:101), and all nine are accounted for in the text (27:1-12, 7:130, 7:133). Thus, the Qur\u2019an tacitly rejects the Passover as a historical event (in contrast to the Hebrew scriptures in which the Passover constitutes the final and greatest of the plagues), a fact which \u2014 if one takes the Qur\u2019an as the measure \u2014 lays an axe to the root of both modern Jews\u2019 conception of themselves, as well as to the Christians\u2019 arrogation to themselves of the same fabrication (albeit in \u2018spiritualised\u2019 form).

Consequently, Razi interprets these two verses as being addressed to man in general, and explains the reference to \u201cwhat We have bestowed upon thee from on high\u201d in the sense given in my rendering. This interpretation makes it clear, moreover, that the above passage is closely connected with verses 57-58, which speak of the guidance vouchsafed to mankind through the ultimate divine writ, the Qur\u2019an.",24],[10,94,2,"2.

In its wider sense, the above verse alludes to the unbroken continuity of man\u2019s religious experience and to the fact, frequently stressed in the Qur\u2019an, that every one of God\u2019s apostles preached one and the same basic truth.

It \u201cowes its fame to the Mesopotamian tradition which identifies it, and not Mount Ararat, with the mountain on which Noah\u2019s ark rested[...] This localization of the ark\u2019s resting-place[...] is certainly based on Babylonian tradition\u201d (Encyclopaedia of Islam I, 1059).

I reproduce with only the lightest editing the excellent comment by Muhammad Asad, himself a Traditionalist Muslim: [...]Although this dialogue is related in the context of the story of Salih and the leaders of the Thamud, its implications have - as is always the case with Qur\u2019anic stories and parables - a universal, timeless import. The stress here is on the intrinsic impossibility of reconciling belief in the One God, whose omniscience and omnipotence, embraces all that exists, with an attribution of divine or semi-divine qualities and functions to anyone or anything else. The subtly-veiled suggestion of the Thamud and its rejection by Salih has a bearing on all religious attitudes based on a desire to \u201cbring God closer to man\u201d through the interposition of alleged \u201cmediators\u201d between Him and man. In primitive religions, this interposition led to the deification of various forces of nature and, subsequently, to the invention of imaginary deities which were thought to act against the background of an undefined, dimly-perceived Supreme Power (for instance, the Moira of the ancient Greeks). In higher religious concepts, this need for mediation assumes the form of personified manifestations of God through subordinate deities (as is the case, in Hinduism, with the personifications of the Absolute Brahma of the Upanishads and the Vedanta in the forms of Vishnu or Shiva), or in His supposed incarnation in human form (as represented in the Christian idea of Jesus as \u201cGod\u2019s son\u201d and the Second Person of the Trinity). And, lastly, God is supposedly \u201cbrought closer to man\u201d by the interposition of a hierarchy of saints, living or dead, whose intercession is sought even by people who consider themselves to be \u201cmonotheists\u201d - and this includes many misguided Muslims who do not realize that their belief in saints as \u201cmediators\u201d between men and God conflicts with the very essence of Islam. The ever-recurring Qur\u2019anic stress on the oneness and uniqueness of God, and the categorical denial of the idea that anyone or anything - whether it be a concrete being or an abstract force - could have the least share in God\u2019s qualities or the least influence on the manner in which He governs the universe aims at freeing man from the self-imposed servitude to an imaginary hierarchy of \u201cmediating powers\u201d, and at making him realize that \u201cwherever you turn, there is God\u2019s countenance\u201d (2:115), and that God is \u201c[always] near, responding [to the call of whoever calls unto Him]\u201d (2:186; also, in a condensed form. in verse 61 of this surah).",229],[11,64,1,"1.

The present context exposes the Traditionalist\u2019s non-Qur\u2019anic assertion that \u1e63al\u0101t is equal to a strict daily prayer regimen, and leaves him with no choice but to attempt to paper over the cracks in the (almost universally safe) assumption that his followers will neither question his motives nor conduct a thorough analysis themselves.

See note to 2:3 and Article SZC. My understanding of this imperative (one directed here to the recipient of the Qur\u2019an alone) derives from the context, and suffers from none of the Traditionalist\u2019s problems with al \u1e63al\u0101t since I treat it, as does the Qur\u2019an, as a generic noun (i.e. a noun the specific meaning of which depends upon the context; cf. al \u1e63abr). Most of the chapter (11:25-95) rehearses the example of warners sent to their respective peoples prior to the destruction of God being made binding upon those peoples. There follows at 11:96-108 a summary of the eternal condition of those on either side of the decision for God. At 11:109-111 the narrative turns to the Prophet, directing his attention to the people of his time and place. At 11:112 he is told to keep to the right path (a path one may reasonably deduce only as a function of what has preceded, and as a directive to act upon that basis). At 11:113 he and those with him are admonished not to place confidence in those who do wrong, with a warning that the Fire will touch them (cf. 11:96-108) as a consequence of disobedience. Now, at 11:114, comes the imperative in question, directed to the Messenger himself. At this point, the Traditionalist has him praying a number of prayers each day. But what about the entire preceding context? The verse at 11:114 also includes the promise: good deeds take away evil deeds! If the claim is that such good deeds comprise performing a prayer regimen the Traditionalist himself cannot find in the Qur\u2019an, that does gross violence to the context at the very least. More likely, given the context, the \u1e63al\u0101t mentioned comprises a call to repentance and reform. By way of confirmation, 11:115 calls the Messenger to patience, whereas 11:116 laments that more people were not found forbidding corruption among former peoples. The only interpretation which makes sense is that at 11:114, the Messenger is to repeat the example of former messengers by doing what they did: forbidding corruption and warning the people. Any other reading removes two-thirds of 11:114 from the context entirely, and produces that stilted dissonance which so characterises any reading which assumes the Traditionalist\u2019s conclusions. My broader (and much more detailed) analysis concludes that this process of warning was to take the form of three discrete concatenated readings taken from between s\u016brah 50 and s\u016brah 114, in a nightly service. Thus, the two ends of the day And at an approach of the night means: the time preceding dawn, and dusk, and the time following dusk. For the full analysis of this service see the section header titled 68:1 towards the end of Article MLQ. See also 17:78 and notes thereto.",24],[11,114,2,"2. Arabic: sayyi\u2019\u0101t.

I have no strong opinion on Muhammad Asad\u2019s comment here, but include it for interest: Some of the earliest commentators (e.g., Mujahid and \u2018Ikrimah) are of the opinion that the expression li-dhalika (rendered by me as \u201cto this end\u201d) refers to God\u2019s bestowal of His grace upon man, while others (e.g., Al-Hasan and \u2018Ata) relate it to men\u2019s ability to differ intellectually from one another. According to Zamakhshari, it refers to the freedom of moral choice which characterizes man and is spoken of in the preceding passages: and since it is this freedom which constitutes God\u2019s special gift to man and raises him above all other created beings (cf. the parable of Adam and the angels in 2:30-34), Zamakhshari\u2019s interpretation is, in my opinion, the most comprehensive of all.",50],[11,119,2,"2.

Although the crops of Egypt depend entirely on the annual Nile floods, the water-level of the river is, in its turn, contingent upon the quantity of rainfall at its upper reaches.

This extremely plausible explanation contrasts sharply with the Biblical account of this incident (Genesis xliv), according to which the false accusation was part of an inexplicable \u201cstratagem\u201d devised by Joseph. If we discard - as we must - this part of the Biblical version, it is far more logical to assume that Joseph, who had been granted by the King full authority over all that belonged to the latter (see verse 56 above), had placed the royal cup as a present in the bag of his favourite brother; and that he did this secretly, without informing his servants, because he did not want anyone, least of all his ten half-brothers, to know his predilection for Benjamin.",112],[12,74,1,"1.

Lane (p. 1746) says that \u1e63inw\u0101n means one of a pair or of more than a pair. He writes: \u201cof palm-trees, or of any trees, or of trees resembling one another, growing from one root; each [or every one] of such being called the \u1e63inw of the other [or others growing with it].\u201d He renders this portion of the verse at 13:4 as: \u201cPalm-trees having one root and [others] having distinct roots.\u201d He goes on to state: \u201cA brother; but not so called unless coupled with another: or a brother by the same father[...] because he has branched forth from one stock [with his father]\u201d. Translators render variously. N. J. Dawood has: and groves of palm, the single and the clustered; A. J.

It is a feminine plural noun based on the m-th-l root, which is found most commonly in the Qur\u2019an with the meanings like or example. Additionally, exemplariness and similitude are concepts which are features of this root. The notion of punishment is implicit in the context and the feminine plural noun here possibly corresponds in a multiple application to the feminine singular noun al sayyi\u2019a (rendered here the evil) which precedes (and which itself undoubtedly references the retribution of God). Other translators generally render here as have I, or with similar punishments.",118],[13,7,1,"1. Arabic: alladh\u012bna kafar\u016b. See note to 2:6 and Notepad II.i.",28],[13,7,2,"2.

This is the case in other languages also (for example, Russian). Occasionally, this can give rise to ambiguity \u2014 which is the case here. The clause can mean either \u2018Thou art but a warner And for every people a guide\u2019 or \u2018Thou art but a warner And for every people is a guide\u2019. A. J. Arberry, for example, renders after the first model, and both N. J. Dawood and Saheeh International after the second. I tend toward the second reading on the basis of the established facts that it is God who guides (cf. 2:272) and that God sends a messenger to every community (cf. 10:47, 16:36). Muhammad Asad broadly concurs in his translation with the conclusion here, rendering: and [in God] all people have a guide. I reproduce his note below in full: According to the classical commentators, this sentence lends itself to several interpretations: (1) \u201cThou art only a warner; and every nation has had a guide like thee (i.e., a prophet)\u201d- which would be in consonance with the Qur\u2019anic doctrine of the continuity of prophetic guidance; or (2) \u201cThou art only a warner - but [at the same time] also a guide unto all people\u201d - which would stress the universality of the Qur\u2019anic message as contrasted with the time-bound and ethnically limited missions of the earlier prophets; or (3) \u201cThou art only a warner bound to do no more than deliver the message entrusted to thee, while it is God alone who can truly guide men\u2019s hearts towards faith\u201d. Since the last of the above three interpretations is the most plausible and has, moreover, the support of \u2018Abd Allah ibn \u2018Abbas, Sa\u2019id ibn Jubayr, Mujahid and Ad-Dahhak, I have adopted it in my rendering. According to Zamakhshari, this interpretation is further strengthened by the subsequent reference to God\u2019s omniscience.",145],[13,10,1,"1. I.e. to God.",14],[13,10,2,"2.

The regular plural ending, and related usage (cf. 72:27) tend to confirm this. The word is the form II active participle of the verb \u02bfaqaba. The form II verb occurs at 27:10 and 28:31 where it means to return, to come back, to look again. The core root senses are: follow after (repeatedly); expose; criticise. The active participle occurs in only one other instance (13:41) where it means critic or adjuster (of the decision of another). Given what we can glean on a pan-textual basis, the sense in the present case appears to be of angels which perform (repeated or relentless) examination or evaluation \u2014 a value which comports with a broader narrative which treats of the futility of hiding anything from God.",25],[13,11,3,"3. Or it. One can take this masculine pronoun object to reference qawl (speech) in the previous verse, although it is commonly (and legitimately) thought to refer to the man himself.",64],[13,11,4,"4. I include Muhammad Asad\u2019s note here for interest: The rendering of the above passage hinges on the meaning given to the term mu\u2019aqqibat-a double plural of mu\u2019aqqib, which signifies \u201csomething that comes immediately after another thing\u201d or \u201csucceeds another thing without interruption\u201d. Most of the classical commentators understand by mu\u2019aqqibat \u201chosts of angels\u201d, i.e., the recording angels who attend on every human being, succeeding one another without interruption. Consequently, they interpret the phrase min bayni yadayhi wa-min khalfihi as meaning \u201cranged before him and behind him\u201d, i.e., surrounding man from all sides; and they explain the words \u201cfrom God\u2019s command\u201d as being here synonymous with \u201cby God\u2019s command\u201d, and take them to refer to the angels or to their function of guardianship. However, this interpretation has by no means the support of all the commentators. Some of the earliest ones assume that the term mu\u2019aqqibat refers to all manner of worldly forces or concepts on which man so often relies in the mistaken belief that they might help him to achieve his aims independently of God\u2019s will: and this is the meaning given to this elliptic passage by the famous commentator Abu Muslim al-Isfahani, as quoted by Razi. Explaining verse 10 and the first part of verse 11, he says: \u201cAll alike are, in God\u2019s knowledge, deeds done secretly or openly, as well as he who hides in the darkness of night and he who walks [boldly] in the light of day... : for he that resorts to the [cover of] night can never elude God\u2019s will (amr), just as he [cannot] that walks in the light of day, surrounded by hosts of helpers (mu\u2019aqqibat)- that is, guards and aids - meant to protect him: [for] those guards of his cannot save him from [the will of] God.\u201d It is on this convincing interpretation that I have based my rendering. The worldly \u201cguards and aids\u201d on which a sinner relies may be tangible (like wealth, progeny, etc.) or intangible (like personal power, high social standing, or the belief in one\u2019s \u201cluck\u201d): and this explains the phrase \u201cboth such as can be perceived by him and such as are hidden from him\u201d.",88],[13,11,5,"5.

The word is commonly translated might or power or assault and synonyms, and I have complied with that convention in translation. However, the m-\u1e25-l root relates more to concepts of cunning or scheming. Commentators have perhaps ascribed what they considered more appropriate values to the word, and the results of this process have entered the lexicons. However, one can see that such values are at odds with the primary root senses. Translators who comment here attempt to resolve this problem. Muhammad Asad explains his decision at this juncture thus: According to Raghib, the expression[...] (which occurs in the Qur\u2019an only in this one place) signifies \u201cpowerful in contriving, in a manner hidden from man, that wherein wisdom lies\u201d.

We are primarily interested in what the Qur\u2019an means by the term; and given what we have already stated as the preponderance of the Qur\u2019an\u2019s treatment of this word, we should default to that value. Lane further cites a value which supports our case: \u201c[...]or, accord. to some of the lexicologists[...] the meaning is, do not then those who have believed despair of the belief of those whom God has described as those who will not believe?\u201d Understood thus, the emphasis is on the anxiety for loved ones that is the daily experience of every compassionate believer, given that God sends those who choose to reject him to Hell (cf. 11:119, 32:13).",229],[13,31,6,"6.

Since sadid signifies anything that is repulsive, it is also used tropically to describe the pus that flows from wounds or the viscous liquid that oozes from corpses. In his commentary on this verse, Razi suggests that the expression ma\u2019 sadid is here purely metaphorical, and should be understood as \u201cwater like [what is described as] sadid\u201d. It is in pursuance of this interpretation that I have rendered the above expression as \u201cwaters of most bitter distress\u201d - a metaphor of the boundless suffering and bitter frustration which, in the life to come, awaits those who during their life in this world were bent on denying all spiritual truths.

While I am not convinced on all points, I include Muhammad Asad\u2019s comment here for broader perspective of the interested student: The term shaytan (\u201csatan\u201d) - derived from the verb shatana (\u201che was [or \u201cbecame\u201d] remote\u201d) - often denotes in the Qur\u2019an a force or influence remote from, and opposed to, all that is true and good (Taj al-\u2019Arus, Raghib): thus, for instance, in 2:14 it is used to describe the evil impulses (shayatin) within the hearts of \u201cthose who are bent on denying the truth\u201d. In its widest, abstract sense it denotes every \u201csatanic force\u201d, i.e., every impulsion directed towards ends which are contrary to valid ethical postulates. In the present context, the phrase \u201cevery satanic force accursed (rajim)\u201d- like the phrase \u201cevery rebellious (marid) satanic force\u201d in a similar context in 37:7 - apparently refers to endeavours, strongly condemned in Islam, to divine the future by means of astrological speculations: hence the preceding reference to the skies and the stars. The statement that God has made the heavens \u201csecure\u201d against such satanic forces obviously implies that He has made it impossible for the latter to obtain, through astrology or what is popularly described as \u201coccult sciences\u201d, any real knowledge of \u201cthat which is beyond the reach of human perception\u201d (al-ghayb).

I agree to some extent with \u2014 and have based my rendering here upon that of \u2014 Muhammad Asad. While I reject the popular, heavily financed, resurrected ancient myth of Evolution (preferring instead the scientific method \u2014 namely something based upon verifiable evidence \u2014 over speculation, myth and the persecution of dissenters) Asad\u2019s note at this point is reproduced here in full: There are many references in the Qur\u2019an to man\u2019s having been \u201ccreated out of clay (tin)\u201d or \u201cout of dust (turab)\u201d, both these terms signifying man\u2019s lowly biological origins as well as the fact that his body is composed of various organic and inorganic substances existing - in other combinations or in their elementary forms - on or in the earth. The term salsal, occurring in three verses of this surah as well as in 55:14, adds a further dimension to this concept. According to most of the philological authorities, it denotes \u201cdried clay that emits a sound\u201d (i.e., when it is struck); and since it is used in the Qur\u2019an exclusively with reference to the creation of man, it seems to contain an allusion to the power of articulate speech which distinguishes man from all other animal species, as well as to the brittleness of his existence (cf. the expression \u201clike pottery\u201d in 55:14). As the construction of the sentence shows, this salsal is stated to have evolved (Razi) out of hama\u2019 - which, according to some authorities, is the plural of ham\u2019ah, signifying \u201cdark, fetid mud\u201d or \u201cdark slime\u201d - while the participial adjective masnun which qualifies this noun denotes, as Razi points out, both \u201caltered\u201d (i.e., in its composition) and \u201cbrought into shape\u201d: hence my rendering of this expression as \u201ctransmuted\u201d, which to some extent combines both of the above meanings. To my mind, we have here a description of the primeval biological environment out of which the \u201csounding clay\u201d - the matrix, as it were - of man\u2019s physical body has evolved in accordance with God\u2019s plan of creation.",66],[15,27,1,"1.

This verb has two key meanings in the text depending on the preposition it uses (for the full set of instances of this form I verb see 4:100, 7:118, 7:134, 10:51, 15:29, 22:65, 27:82, 27:85, 38:72, 56:1, 69:15). As a rule, it means to occur, to befall. It is true (as per the Traditionalist\u2019s claim here) that it also means to fall down. However, in this case the nearest preposition is in la. The Traditionalist wishes the reader to think that it means to fall down to him and the reason he wants this is that if he can get us to ascribe a purely physical value to the s-j-d root, he can begin to shoehorn his religion into the mind of the reader on that basis. However, from what I could find in the lexicons, waqa\u02bfa does not normally take an object when it means to fall down and it does not take one with la except in its other sense of to befall (something befell him would take la before him). The verb sajada, however, does take la (see for example 22:18). Of course it is possible for a priesthood to plead special cases for Qur\u2019anic usage ad infinitum in order to achieve predetermined outcomes, but if the points above be granted, the sense here must be: fall down, to him in submission.

This was the country of Thamood. If correct, this lends support to the thesis that the narrative takes place in the Nabataean region, and not that of southern \u1e24ej\u0101z. There is an archaeological site in northern Arabia under the auspices of UNESCO called Al-\u1e24ijr which is the largest site of the civilisation of the Nabataeans south of Petra and comprises houses hewn out of the rock face. This data fits neatly with the Petra thesis. However, the Arabia Felix thesis advances some claims for its locale in this regard. What is beyond question is that the Qur\u2019an treats the history of the people of al \u1e25ijr as something known to the initial hearers of the Qur\u2019an. See also Notepad XVI.",37],[15,81,1,"1.

Arabic: math\u0101ni. The root meanings of th-n-y are doubling, pairing and repetition. Frankly, the present case could indicate either. By way of illustration, Muhammad Asad comments at 39:23 (the only other instance of this word) where he himself opts for an emphasis on repetition: [...]Another possible meaning, preferred by Razi, is \u201cpairing its statements\u201d, i.e., referring to the polarity stressed in all Qur\u2019anic teachings (e.g., command and prohibition, duties and rights, reward and punishment, paradise and hell, light and darkness, the general and the specific, and so forth). The Traditionalist typically claims the present context to indicate the seven verses of al f\u0101ti\u1e25ah. That position assumes two things: firstly, that the bismillah there is part of the revelation; and secondly, that the verse divisions (or at least the number thereof) are equal to seven verses. The Traditionalist\u2019s interpretation here has foundation no matter which of the senses for math\u0101ni one accepts. The verses of al f\u0101ti\u1e25ah are certainly oft-repeated (if every nominal Muslim performs the daily rituals the Sunni Traditionalist claims as compulsory and in the way he claims they must be performed, al f\u0101ti\u1e25ah is currently repeated almost ten trillion times each year). On the other hand, the verses of al f\u0101ti\u1e25ah are \u2018oft-paired\u2019 with other portions of the Qur\u2019an during parts of his ritual regimen; that is: al f\u0101ti\u1e25ah is recited, then some other portion of the Qur\u2019an (admittedly, with less frequency than al f\u0101ti\u1e25ah itself is repeated).

In addition to pairs, spouses, azw\u0101j is said to mean categories or kinds. Muhammad Asad comments here: The philological authorities are unanimous in that the plural noun azwaj denotes here \u201ckinds\u201d of people, or \u201csome\u201d of them, and not - as certain modern translators of the Qur\u2019an have assumed - \u201cpairs\u201d. Historically, unanimity among authorities of any kind has provided little to encourage one who would uncover what the Qur\u2019an has to say, and that state of affairs continues to this day. Nevertheless, the sense for zawj / azw\u0101j which Muhammad Asad mentions is supported by Lane (pp. 1272-1273). More importantly, considered from the point of view of Qur\u2019anic pan-textual analysis, we find this usage mirrored at one other place \u2014 38:58 \u2014 thus forming a pair, a fact we find significant given the value of pairing we have opted for at 15:87 (see note thereto) and the core meaning of the word presently under discussion. Here at 15:88, we find an admonition to disregard the seeming advantages enjoyed by those heedless to the message of warning. And at 38:58 which we identify as the corollary to 15:88 on the basis of it (second) like usage of azw\u0101j (thus forming a pair), the context treats of the fate of the heedless as an accomplished fact, comparing the torments of Hell suffered by them with the pleasures of the Garden for those of faith. Identification of embedded connections of this type between segments of the Qur\u2019an help us broaden our understanding of its message and deepen our appreciation of its structure.",76],[15,88,2,"2. This phrase occurs additionally at 16:127 and 27:70. In those instances the immediate context treats of those who scheme against the mission of the Messenger. This fact will be of increasing relevance as we unpack the lines that follow in the notes. We know as a certainty that the recipient of the Qur\u2019an had been appointed adversaries who tried to fabricate against the revelation he received (cf. 6:112). Both on this basis, and on the basis of the reasoning contained in the notes to this portion, I take the segment beginning here through to the end of 15:90 as a parenthetical aside.",116],[15,88,3,"3.

The inclusion of the definite article in this sole instance adds conspicuous specificity to this context. What the Messenger brought is clear.

Sc. so shall We do again. Arabic: al muqtasim\u016bn. This is the only instance of the form VIII of this verb, which fact leaves it vulnerable to spurious values. The Traditionalist emphasises here values of division, his assertion being that the reference is to a (claimed) practice of dividing or separating scripture extant among recipients of previous revelation. However, the context does not treat of that topic \u2014 or of anything remotely connected with it. Additionally, the verb form itself contains the nuance of dividing or distributing among themselves (see for example Wehr, p. 893), a nuance the Traditionalist disregards. While the operative verb here (Arabic: anzala \u2014 to send down) together with \u02bfal\u0101 is used both for good things (such as rain) as well as for punishments (scourges or annihilation), the preceding words I am the clear warner (see note to 15:89) can leave us in no doubt as to which of the two options is in view. The Traditionalist also disregards the dominant theme of the chapter as a whole: the extent of provision allowed to former peoples (and, by extension to the present hearers) prior to their destruction (verses 15:3-4 set the tone for what follows). On the basis of these facts, surely the payload here is a warning to those made materially comfortable by distributing the good things of this life among themselves. The obvious thematic cross-reference \u2014 at least, one obvious to anyone accustomed to think of the Qur\u2019an as a complete text rather than as a dartboard at which to throw snippets of a much later literature \u2014 is at 59:7 where we read that it be not a distribution by turns between the rich among you. We note also that the immediate context at 59:7 required systematic analysis of the type needed here in order to reintegrate the words on the page with the context subsequent to the Traditionalist\u2019s externally derived assaults upon the text (I am referring, of course, to the Traditionalist\u2019s unrelenting abuse of the words: And what the Messenger gives you, take it at 59:7). This fact brings us to our last point: the opening word of 15:90 (Arabic: kam\u0101 \u2014 like as) has no preceding thought, which fact compels a conclusion by means of ellipsis, which must be derived from the context. See also my work The God Protocol which features Qur\u2019anic support for my assertion that Mu\u1e25ammad\u2019s initial audience was destroyed by an act of God.

If one is to believe the Qur\u2019an rather than the stories written down centuries afterwards which comprise the principal reading of those who claim the banner of a religion known as Islam, we find that the Qur\u2019an itself was written down in full at the time of the revelation, and that both the content and the ordering thereof are from God. On that basis one may reasonably conclude \u2014 in fact, must conclude \u2014 that as new revelation was sent down the text was added to, and sections inserted into the existing corpus, until such time as the revelation was complete. This, logically, is the process alluded to here. The Messenger is told here to seek refuge with God at two times: 1. When he recites the Qur\u2019an (i.e. when he receives words from God which he repeats aloud; cf. 16:98) and, 2. When those words are placed in writing into the existing corpus. The surrounding context fully supports this assertion. The Traditionalist employs a formula derived, one assumes, from 16:98 before engaging in any recitation of the Qur\u2019an. Given that the Qur\u2019anic imperative is both directed to the recipient of the Qur\u2019an and includes 16:101 in its remit, one cannot help feeling that the Traditionalist\u2019s practice is somewhat indicative of his general condition, since he initiates his reading with a declaration which itself shows that he does not understand (at least the present portion of) the book he intends to recite.",19],[16,101,3,"3.

This nuance is conveyed to the reader without access to the Arabic by Muhammad Asad in his comment here: I.e., the gradualness of revelation (implied in the verbal form yunazzil) corresponds to God\u2019s plan, according to which He has gradually unfolded His will to man, substituting one dispensation for another in the measure of mankind\u2019s intellectual and social development, bringing it to its culmination in the message of the Qur\u2019an.",94],[16,101,6,"6.

The term here (Arabic: bashar) is used in the text in the generic sense of man as in mortal (consider 3:47 and 19:20 where Maryam points out that no mortal has touched her). True to his characteristic trait of seeking to insinuate himself by means of usurping generic terms, perhaps predictably, the Traditionalist has a range of (conflicting) stories concerning the identity of the \u2018man\u2019 at 16:103. The overlay of his emphasis impels most translations to emphasise the man at 16:103 rather than the tongue which is the natural focus of the verse. Given the context \u2014 one in which mention has just been made of The Spirit of Holiness \u2014 it is not unreasonable to conclude the language referenced here to be either Hebrew or Greek: the former as the principal language of the Hebrew Bible, and the latter as the language of the Christian scriptures as well as that of Byzantium (which point would support a location for the Qur\u2019anic revelation much further north than that claimed by the Traditionalist).

Muhammad Asad, perhaps typically, has a somewhat exalted value: a man who combined within himself all virtues. I have complied here with the most common value used by translators, and I supply Muhammad Asad\u2019s comment for interest only: This is one of the many meanings of the term ummah and, to my mind, the one most appropriate in the above context. - The mention of Abraham at this place contains a subtle allusion to verse 118, where the Jews are spoken of: for, the latter claim to be \u201cthe chosen people\u201d on account of their descent from Abraham, whereas the Qur\u2019an consistently rejects all claims to a special status by virtue of one\u2019s descent. Moreover, the Qur\u2019an states in many places that whereas this particular ancestor of the Hebrews - and, by the way, of most of the Arab tribes as well - was a personification of all that is good and upright, so that \u201cGod exalted him with His love\u201d (4:125), his Jewish descendants always tended to rebel against God and, thus, \u201cpersistently wronged themselves\u201d.",21],[16,120,2,"2.

I understand this to indicate Sabbath and the sense to relate to those who say they follow M\u016bs\u0101 and those who say they follow Jesus (conflated with \u02bf\u012as\u0101; see Notepad XVI and Notepad XVIII) and who observe Sabbath on different days. However, the object could also mean him. Muhammad Asad takes it in that sense, for example, and relates it to Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. While I am not persuaded by his argument, I include it for interest: The implication is that the majority of the Jews had deviated from the true creed of Abraham (which is the meaning of the phrase, \u201cthose who came to hold divergent views about him\u201d) inasmuch as most of them became convinced that they were \u201cGod\u2019s chosen people\u201d simply because of their physical descent from that great Prophet: an assumption which obviously runs counter to every truly religious principle. As the Qur\u2019an repeatedly points out, this spiritual arrogance was punished by God\u2019s imposition on the children of Israel - and on them alone - of all manner of severe restrictions and rituals, of which the obligation to refrain from all work and even travel on the Sabbath was one. In its widest implication, this passage is meant to stress the fact that all God-imposed rituals are only a means towards the achievement of spiritual discipline, and never a religious goal in themselves.",68],[16,125,1,"1. See note to wisdom (\u1e25ikma) at 33:34.",47],[16,126,1,"1. The preceding verses treat of doctrinal skirmishes with those of existing faiths in the context of God\u2019s overarching knowledge. Nevertheless, the Traditionalist frequently leaps here into assumptions about military matters. Muhammad Asad identifies the point that has evaded so many other Traditionalists: Lit., \u201cretaliate [or \u201crespond\u201d] with the like of what you have been afflicted with\u201d: thus, the believers are admonished to observe self-restraint while arguing with people of another persuasion, and never to offend against decency and intellectual equity. Although retaliation in argument is permissible if one\u2019s integrity is impeached by an opponent, the sequence makes it clear that it is morally preferable to renounce it altogether and to bear the unjust attack with patience.",21],[16,128,1,"1.

Arabic: aq\u1e63\u0101 \u2014 furthest. This is the plain meaning of this word. It occurs twice more in the text (28:20, 36:20), and is rendered thus by most translators.",104],[17,1,4,"4. Arabic: al masjid al aq\u1e63\u0101. See Notepad VII.iii and Notepad XVI. The Traditionalist links this verse to a claim originating in the \u1e25ad\u012bth literature wherein Mu\u1e25ammad is said to have entered the heavens on the back of a mythological steed and negotiated with God on the number of daily prayers. This is a crucial connection, since without it the Traditionalist\u2019s claim for the divine nature of what he calls al \u1e63al\u0101t (his highly specified understanding of which he has made a pillar of his religion) can point to no definitive purchase within the Qur\u2019an. The details of the Traditionalist\u2019s narrative (in which Mu\u1e25ammad supposedly meets M\u016bs\u0101 who encourages him to beat God down to a manageable number of prayers) is anathema to the Qur\u2019an, and has more in common with parts of the Talmud. In any event, the claim that al masjid al aq\u1e63\u0101 indicates the mosque of that name in Jerusalem is clearly erroneous since no such building existed until after the Muslims took Jerusalem. I can offer three options at this juncture. Firstly, one could argue that the present context suggests M\u016bs\u0101 rather than Mu\u1e25ammad as the subject since M\u016bs\u0101 is the first person named in the segment; an assessment which comparison with 27:8 might support. Within the Petra thesis \u2014 or, at least, the Petra pilgrimage thesis \u2014 one may reasonably suppose 17:1 to indicate a journey from al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m (in Petra) to Jabal al Lawz in Midian in the northern part of what today is Saudi Arabia near the border with Jordan about 120 miles away, if one takes al masjid al aq\u1e63\u0101 to indicate that place M\u016bs\u0101 received the Commandments and accepts Jabal al Lawz as its location. Secondly, if one considers the instances where We blessed (Arabic: b\u0101rakn\u0101) occurs across the text, one could form the view that the reference is to Ibr\u0101h\u012bm (see 7:137, 17:1, 21:71, 21:81, 34:18, 37:113). Thirdly, if we take Petra as the location of al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m and assume the land of modern Israel as that of the prophets, then the allusion is simply to a night journey undertaken by Mu\u1e25ammad from Nabataean Arabia towards Jerusalem, a route along the King\u2019s Highway which inevitably would have presented him with a vista of the cities of L\u016b\u1e6d destroyed by God by the Dead Sea (cf. 15:73-77, 25:40, 37:133-138).",123],[17,1,5,"5.

At the time of the first edition of this work, I was of the view that the latter half of 17:7 referred to a future event; I have revised the position. Since Muhammad Asad summarises the position I have come to, I allow him to make his own points below.",101],[17,5,1,"1. Muhammad Asad notes here: The term \u2018ibad, rendered by me above as \u201cbondmen\u201d, denotes every kind of \u201ccreated beings\u201d (in this case, obviously human beings) inasmuch as all of them are, willingly or unwillingly, subservient to God\u2019s will[...]. It is probable that the phrase \u201cOur bondmen of terrible prowess in war\u201d relates to the Assyrians who overran Palestine in the seventh century B.C. and caused the disappearance of the greater part of the Hebrew nation (the ten \u201clost tribes\u201d), and to the Babylonians who, about one hundred years later, destroyed Solomon\u2019s Temple and carried off the remainder of the children of Israel into captivity, or to both, thus comprising all these events within one \u201cperiod\u201d (see foregoing note).- God\u2019s \u201csending\u201d tribulations upon reprobate sinners is here, as elsewhere in the Qur\u2019an, a metonym for the natural law of cause and effect to which, in the long run, the life of man-and particularly the corporate life of nations and communities - is subject.",85],[17,6,1,"1. Muhammad Asad notes here: [...]apparently a reference to the return of the Jews from the Babylonian captivity in the last quarter of the sixth century B.C., the partial re-establishment of their state, and the building of a new temple in the place of the one that had been destroyed. I agree with Asad\u2019s assessment insofar as it applies to a portion of the children of Israel. However, I would point out that \u2014 even if one is to accept (to whatever extent) an identification of those called Jews after this point in history with those called Jews today \u2014 Jews (principally Judahites) comprised only a fraction of the children of Israel, and that the promises of God were to the children of Israel, not to \u201cthe Jews\u201d. This question is beyond the purview of the present work.",41],[17,7,1,"1. I.e. yourselves.",77],[17,7,2,"2. Sc.

Inasmuch as the face is the most prominent and expressive part of the human body, it is often used as a metonym for one\u2019s whole being; hence, the \u201cevil done to one\u2019s face\u201d is synonymous with \u201cutter disgrace\u201d. Most probably, this passage relates to the destruction of the Second Temple and of Jewish statehood by Titus in the year 70 of the Christian era. While I agree with his broader point, Asad speaks here of \u201cJewish statehood\u201d; what one means by \u201cJewish\u201d \u2014 or, rather, what those who claim to be \u201cJewish\u201d mean by it \u2014 is a modern shell game, and a question we must leave beyond restating our point above that the promises made by God cited in this segment were to the children of Israel, not to \u201cthe Jews\u201d.",164],[17,7,4,"4. Arabic: masjid, mas\u0101jid. See Notepad VII.i. See note to 18:21.",196],[17,8,1,"1. I.e. to punishment. Responsibility is placed squarely on the shoulders of the people concerned. The children of Israel were offered a high calling. They were intended to be witnesses to \u2014 and teachers of \u2014 the Torah. The Qur\u2019an exhorts them to remember that calling and to abide by it. The tenor of the present phrase certainly reflects the essence of the two segments of the Hebrew scriptures Muhammad Asad cites at 17:4, although, I feel, permitting of a broader preamble than he allows, namely: Leviticus 26:1-46 and Deuteronomy 28:1-68. It is worth adding at this juncture that, while I accept that those who identify as Jews and genuinely follow the Torah (and not a usurping literature created by rabbis) are righteous before God, I am yet to be convinced of the extent to which those called Jews today bear a racial connection with the children of Israel who accompanied M\u016bs\u0101.",83],[17,8,2,"2.

For example, Saheeh International has: And man supplicates for evil [when angry] as he supplicates for good. But I agree with A. J. Arberry: Man prays for evil, as he prays for good, whose rendering I take to agree with that of with Muhammad Asad: man [often] prays for things that are bad as if he were praying for something that is good. These latter renderings treat directly of the words on the page, and of the sense, which I take it to be that man appeals to God for what he sees as good without understanding that some of what he regards as good is, in fact, evil. Muhammad Asad adds here: Cf. 2:216 - \u201cit may well be that you hate a thing the while it is good for you, and it may well be that you love a thing the while it is bad for you: and God knows, whereas you do not know\u201d: in other words, divine guidance is the only objective criterion as to what is good and what is bad.",58],[17,11,2,"2.

Since, as the Qamus points out, this phrase denotes also \u201cthe years of [a person\u2019s] life, which he counts\u201d, it obviously implies here a call to spiritual self-criticism in view of the ephemeral nature of one\u2019s worldly life.",208],[17,12,5,"5.

Muhammad Asad comments here: The word ta\u2019ir literally signifies a \u201cbird\u201d or, more properly, a \u201cflying creature\u201d. Since the pre-Islamic Arabs often endeavoured to establish a good or bad omen and, in general, to foretell the future from the manner and direction in which birds would fly, the term ta\u2019ir came to be tropically used in the sense of \u201cfortune\u201d, both good and evil, or \u201cdestiny\u201d[...] It should, however, be borne in mind that the Qur\u2019anic concept of \u201cdestiny\u201d relates not so much to the external circumstances of and events in man\u2019s life as, rather, to the direction which this life takes in result of one\u2019s moral choices: in other words, it relates to man\u2019s spiritual fate - and this, in its turn, depends - as the Qur\u2019an so often points out - on a person\u2019s inclinations, attitudes and conscious actions (including self-restraint from morally bad actions or, alternatively, a deliberate omission of good actions). Hence, man\u2019s spiritual fate depends on himself and is inseparably linked with the whole tenor of his personality; and since it is God who has made man responsible for his behaviour on earth, He speaks of Himself as having \u201ctied every human being\u2019s destiny to his neck\u201d.

Muhammad Asad supplies what I regard as a helpful insight here; and while I do not share his view that there exists such a thing as \u2018Judaeo-Christian\u2019 in reality, I reproduce his note with some light editing: This highly elliptic sentence has a fundamental bearing on the purport of the Qur\u2019an as a whole. In many places the Qur\u2019an stresses the fact that the Prophet Muhammad[...] was not empowered to perform miracles similar to those with which the earlier prophets are said to have reinforced their verbal messages. His only miracle was and is the Qur\u2019an itself - a message perfect in its lucidity and ethical comprehensiveness, destined for all times and all stages of human development, addressed not merely to the feelings but also to the minds of men, open to everyone, whatever his race or social environment, and bound to remain unchanged forever. Since the earlier prophets invariably appealed to their own community and their own time alone, their teachings were, of necessity, circumscribed by the social and intellectual conditions of that particular community and time; and since the people to whom they addressed themselves had not yet reached the stage of independent thinking, those prophets stood in need of symbolic portents or miracles[...] in order to make the people concerned realize the inner truth of their mission. The message of the Qur\u2019an, on the other hand, was revealed at a time when mankind (and, in particular, that part of it which inhabited the regions marked by the earlier, Judaeo-Christian religious development) had reached a degree of maturity which henceforth enabled it to grasp an ideology as such without the aid of those persuasive portents and miraculous demonstrations which in the past, as the above verse points out, only too often gave rise to new, grave misconceptions.",85],[17,59,3,"3.

All translators \u2014 at least those who deliver syntactically correct English at this juncture \u2014 infer ellipsis, and supply what they feel is implied by one means or another, making their additions at different places within the verse, and with varying levels of disclosure to the reader with no access to the original Arabic. The question, then, is only what should be supplied and where. To take the second item first, we should look to the next verse since it begins with the same formula (Arabic: wa idh quln\u0101) we find here at 17:60. Since the line beginning that verse introduces a complete thought, a requirement of completion may be inferred for 17:60, and I place the ellipsis accordingly. We look next to the surrounding text for what is implied. The immediate context treats of dread, and the ellipsis is interpreted on that basis. Additionally, what immediately follows the formula (Arabic: wa idh quln\u0101) at 17:61 treats of compliance with \u2014 or submission to \u2014 the word of God, and that compliance is both anticipated and mirrored at 17:60 by means of the text we have supplied. Lastly, there is an implied counterpoint between what happened when the recipient of the Qur\u2019an was put in dread (he became the servant of God), and what we find at the end of 17:60 (that though God puts men in dread, those among mankind for whom the vision Mu\u1e25ammad received was a means of denial, it serves only to increase them in great inordinacy). While I do not supply the arguments in this work, I contend that this phrase anticipates those who made identification of the later so-called mir\u0101j story and \u2018the vision\u2019 mentioned here an article of faith; any such connection is dispatched \u2014 and the textually-supported meaning of \u2018the vision\u2019 established \u2014 by means of detailed pan-textual analysis in my work The God Protocol.",62],[17,60,2,"2.

In all other cases, it is \u2014 by common consent \u2014 connected directly or indirectly with the concept of following. In this case alone, it is asserted in translations to have the value of avenger or prosecutor. Wehr (p. 109) gives the meaning of tab\u012b\u02bf as follower, adherent, partisan; aide, help, assistant, attendant, servant. Lane (p. 295) covers much the same ground as Wehr but includes the sense of prosecutor (for a right or due; particularly blood-revenge), but notes that tab\u012b\u02bf also signifies an aider (especially against an enemy). Plainly there is some correlation between a follower and one who acts to prosecute in favour of a particular person, but that connection is tenuous, and in my view it should not supersede 171 instances of the root without very strong textual support (which support I am yet to see provided by those who favour prosecutor and analogues here). Muhammad Asad comes closest to what I regard as the pan-textual sense among those translators I reviewed by rendering: whereupon you would find none to uphold you against Us. The import, then, is this: no man lost at sea in a raging storm would find anyone who would choose to share his lot and take his part against God since atheism simply evaporates on a damaged ship in a tempest (cf. 17:67).

Among non-sectarian translators some present another emphasis. N. J. Dawood, for example, has each community, which is a more correct reading pan-textually. The expression rendered here each people (Arabic: kulli un\u0101sin) occurs in two other places (2:60, 7:160), both of which treat of a context in which kulli un\u0101sin can only signify separate peoples or tribes.",27],[17,71,2,"2.

Arabic: rakana (il\u0101)\u2014 to lean, support one\u2019s weight upon; to trust in, rely on. A value of to incline towards is favoured by most translators, which tendency arises, in my view, in doctrinal concerns rather than in objective lexical values. This preferred value is certainly included among those Lane, for example, cites (p.1154). And insofar as to incline towards meant (when Lane was writing) to rely upon, this value is correct. However, to incline towards is a fuzzy value today (meaning something between to be favourably disposed towards and to be willing to listen to). But such values are not what is meant here. Lane makes clear that to incline towards is a synonym of to trust in, to rely upon: \u201cHe inclined to him, or it; and he trusted to, or relied upon him, or it, so as to be, or become easy, or quiet, in mind[...]\u201d.

The question is only what the elided value is, and where in the verse it comes. The mention of \u2018practice\u2019 as here (Arabic: sunnah) is found in comparable contexts at 17:77, 33:38-39, 33:62, 35:43, 40:85, 48:23. At both 35:43 and 48:23 it is supported by the statement: and thou wilt not find in the practice of God any change. At 35:43 this statement itself is immediately followed by: nor wilt thou find in the practice of God any alteration. This statement itself is closely mirrored here at 17:77 immediately following the opening line to the verse. Clearly, these two thoughts go together.

The purport here, naturally, is construed by the Traditionalist in accordance with a pre-existing expectation of a \u2018prayer\u2019 regimen. The context fits better an obligation to warn by means of the Qur\u2019an, which point we expand upon in the notes following. See also Notepad XXI (cf. also 50:40, 68:42, 68:43).",20],[17,78,2,"2. Arabic: dul\u016bk. The primary meaning of the verb with which this noun is associated is to rub or to press or to squeeze (often: until things merge). The expression dul\u016bk al shams signifies that time at which the sun seems to merge with the horizon. The expression dul\u016bk al shams is noted by Wehr (p. 335) as sunset. The Traditionalist has two problems at this point. Firstly, he is unable to conceive of al \u1e63al\u0101t as the generic, abstract noun it clearly is (cf. al \u1e63abr). And, secondly, having particularised the general, he has also locked himself into the dogma of five daily rituals on the basis of his non-Qur\u2019anic literature. He is in the unenviable position of Cinderella\u2019s ugly sisters: he must make the glass slipper fit come what may, but reality is against him. Thus, he has it that dul\u016bk al shams means the time after the sun passes the meridian. By extending his notion of sunset in this way, he can convince himself that what is meant here is provision for a number of \u2018prayers\u2019 nowhere mentioned here in the text. By way of example, the Traditionalist translators at Saheeh International render here Establish prayer at the decline of the sun [from its meridian] until the darkness of the night, to which they add the note: i.e., the period which includes the thuhr, a\u1e63r, maghrib, and \u2018ish\u0101\u2019 prayers. The Traditionalist just needs to get one more of his five-prayer set through the goalposts. But this is sleight of hand, and any reasonably intelligent child without prior indoctrination would recognise it as such. What no one seems to ask is: if four \u2018prayers\u2019 can be found in this space, why not six, or ten \u2014 or a hundred? The fact is that the Traditionalist is locked in to values taken from elsewhere, and is committed to cramming the glass slipper onto a fat, hairy foot no matter if it shatters in the process \u2014 which, of course, in the light of any sensible analysis, it does (one has only to consider 11:114 for the Traditionalist\u2019s manipulations with dul\u016bk al shams to be exposed, despite the incursions the Traditionalist employs against the plain sense of the text there also). And, again, no matter what the precise meaning of aq\u0101ma al \u1e63al\u0101t in this segment, the indisputable fact is that both here and at 11:114 the imperative is in the singular. I have no objection to prayer, including to that of the Traditionalist, minor points notwithstanding. I have no objection to prayers being held at the time the Traditionalist holds them, or at any other time. I do object to his practice of claiming monopoly rights over a book which itself claims to be from God and complete, and then of importing his values for key terms in that book from elsewhere and proceeding to attack anyone who doesn\u2019t agree with him. And I also object to his allied practice of manipulating the plain sense of the text to make it seem to fit with his externally derived requirements. If he doesn\u2019t wish to take the Qur\u2019an at its own estimation that is his affair, but he should not hinder those who do.",36],[17,78,3,"3.

Arabic: qur\u2019\u0101n \u2014 reading, recital, recitation, something which is read out.",118],[17,78,5,"5. I will present the Traditionalist\u2019s claims for this statement in their best possible light before explaining why I don\u2019t agree with them. Muhammad Asad notes here: Most of the classical commentators take this to mean \u201cwitnessed by the angels of night as well as those of day\u201d, since dawn is the time between night and day. Razi, however, is of the opinion that the \u201cwitness\u201d to which the Qur\u2019an refers here is the spark of God-given illumination in man\u2019s own soul - the heightening of his inner perception at the time when the darkness and stillness of night begins to give way to the life-giving light of day, so that prayer becomes a means of attaining to deeper insight into the realm of spiritual truths and, thus, of achieving communion with all that is holy. This is all very uplifting, but it is plucked from the ether; it has no purchase in the Qur\u2019an. The passive participle mashh\u016br (witnessed) occurs in three places: 11:103, 85:3, and here at 17:78. At 11:103, the context anticipates the Day of Judgment; it is a day to which mankind (al n\u0101s) is being gathered, and that day is \u201cwitnessed\u201d. The active party here is God; the object, human beings. At 85:3, the preceding context (provided at 85:1-2) is an oath which includes the Day of Judgment (cf. 11:103), and the key phrase the \u201cwitnessed\u201d precedes actions by men in which they (men) are themselves \u201cwitnesses\u201d (see 85:4-9). The segment concludes with the statement that God is \u201cwitness\u201d over all things. Thus, the \u201cwitness\u201d of 85:3 must refer in the first instance to God, and the \u201cwitnessed\u201d of 85:3 to that which men have done and seen. And on the basis of what we have learned at 11:103 and 85:3, \u201cthe witnessed\u201d of 17:78 must refer to that which is done and seen by men. My analysis of \u2018the mysterious letters\u2019 (Arabic: al \u1e25ur\u016bf al muqa\u1e6d\u1e6da\u02bf\u0101t) contains within it evidence of a series of three portions of the Qur\u2019an beginning at s\u016brah 50, and which the Qur\u2019an itself calls al suj\u016bd. These sections comprise the text to be recited as a witness to those the Messenger was sent to warn. (This process is likely retained by parts of the Traditionalist\u2019s prayer regimen in vestigial form, though he has lost its original purpose entirely.) These readings were to be open for attendance by men. The \u2018recitation of dawn\u2019 was to be \u2018witnessed\u2019 by men at the conclusion of a process in which al suj\u016bd portions of the Qur\u2019an were recited, and in the course of which existing believers worshipped, and outsiders who heard the message either walked away or remained (i.e. until dawn) and submitted to God. I suggest the interested student read from s\u016brah 50 onwards with these assertions in view in order to judge for himself how readily such a position comports with the text. For my full analysis of \u2018the mysterious letters\u2019 see Article MLQ.",140],[17,79,1,"1. Arabic: tahajjad. This is the only instance of the root (h-j-d) from which this word comes. Thus, we have nothing to compare with in the text, and the word is highly vulnerable to the type of lexical manipulations of Qur\u2019anic terms which characterise the Traditionalist\u2019s method. This word now means relinquish sleep for prayer. And a review of Lane\u2019s entry for the verb (p. 2940) shows the root of the verb to be firmly fixed in notions of sleep (either succumbing to it or refraining from it). Clearly, from the context at 17:79, the latter is meant. I think it is safe to regard the Traditionalist\u2019s preferred emphasis on prayer (and here he means the prayer he can point to nowhere in the Qur\u2019an but which he insists is from God) as a case of culture affecting lexical sense over time. It is clear to see how this would have happened. In agreement with the non-sectarian Arabist A. J. Arberry I have used vigil, which emphasises wakefulness, but allows for worship and remembrance of God also. In the context of my view of 17:78, the imperative here informs part of that process by which men were warned by means of the Qur\u2019an (see notes to 17:77 and 17:78).",38],[17,79,2,"2. Arabic: bihi \u2014 with it (i.e. with the Qur\u2019an). Both Saheeh International and Hilali & Khan make this point explicitly.",48],[17,79,3,"3. The Traditionalist has given this word (Arabic: n\u0101fila) a highly technical meaning of supererogatory prayer. This is a clever piece of manipulation because, firstly, it assumes acceptance of the claim that there exists a baseline number of prayers and, secondly, because it assumes acceptance of the claim that prayer in the sense he means it is the subject here. This is possible only if one has already accepted a non-Qur\u2019anic value for al \u1e63al\u0101t at the hand of the Traditionalist. However, we can cross-reference n\u0101fila, since it occurs at one other place: 21:72. There the context is Ya\u02bfq\u016bb being given to Ibr\u0101h\u012bm in addition to Is\u1e25\u0101q. Thus, n\u0101fila could indicate any number of things at 17:79 \u2014 an additional duty, an additional merit, an additional time, or some other additional value. To assume a special prayer (the details of which the Traditionalist claims to know, naturally) is to impose upon the text rather than to draw from it. And, as in the previous verse, the imperative here is in the singular and clearly directed to the Prophet himself, which could be seen to give the Traditionalist\u2019s claims for this segment regarding himself a presumptuous and inappropriate flavour.",64],[17,79,4,"4. Arabic: maq\u0101m. See note to 2:125. At this point the average Traditionalist claims for Mu\u1e25ammad what the average Christian claims for Jesus: the right of intercession \u2014 that one man can get God to close his eyes to his sins on the basis of another man\u2019s righteousness or intercession. Saheeh International (whose translation and position is entirely reflective of Sunni orthodoxy) notes here: The position of intercession by permission of All\u0101h and the highest degree in Paradise. I reject this position entirely. It is antithetical to the spirit and letter of the revelation Mu\u1e25ammad brought on any number of counts. The same translators then note: This is a promise from All\u0101h (sub\u1e25\u0101nahu wa ta\u2018\u0101l\u0101) to Prophet Mu\u1e25ammad (\u1e63)). They are seemingly oblivious to the contradiction between this claim and the Traditionalist\u2019s insistence that the first half of the verse (given the Traditionalist\u2019s understanding of it) has application for himself \u2014 and all other Muslims \u2014 personally.",137],[17,81,1,"1.

It is obviously used here to refute, once again, the idea that the children of Israel are a \u201cchosen people\u201d by virtue of their Abrahamic descent and, therefore, a priori and invariably destined for God\u2019s grace. The Qur\u2019an rejects this claim by stating that on Resurrection Day all mankind will be judged, and none will have a privileged position.",162],[17,105,1,"1. Arabic: bil \u1e25aqqi.

Arabic: \u02bfal\u0101 mukthin \u2014 at intervals. This noun occurs nowhere else in the text, but the use of the verb (13:17, 20:10, 27:22, 28:29) and the active participle (18:3, 43:77) from the same root comports with the sense of the noun as understood here. Muhammad Asad renders here in stages. Both Hilali & Khan and A. J. Arberry have at intervals. Saheeh International is committed to a value which emphasises the duration of the revelation (the details of which, as Traditionalist translators, naturally, they claim to know). However, while the concept of duration is entirely consonant with the meaning and usage of the root in other places in the text, to my knowledge the Traditionalist does not claim that the Messenger stopped reciting the Qur\u2019an at the point new revelation ceased, nor would support for such a view be found in the Qur\u2019an. Thus, no matter what some Traditionalists imply or would have us infer here, the fact is the notion of duration implicit in this context could not mean what they would like it to (namely, the totality of the time over which the Qur\u2019an was sent down, claimed by them to be twenty-three years). And that much granted, the fact is that in this context any duration is more likely to refer to a humanly achievable unit of recitation (such as an hour or so), than to the value of twenty-three years taken from a non-Qur\u2019anic source. And if one agrees thus far, then what one means by duration and intervals becomes effectively the same thing. In addition, I would argue that we find here (over and above the plain sense of announcing new revelation as it was received) strong support for the process of al suj\u016bd identified in this work as the reading of one of a number of specific portions of the Qur\u2019an between chapter 50 and the end of chapter 114 in a nightly vigil to which outsiders are also invited to hear the message of the Qur\u2019an.

This word (the only instance of the root) occurs three times: 17:107, 17:109, 36:8. It means chins. At 36:8 it means chins \u2014 a point uncontested by the Traditionalist who renders there thus himself. Here, however, he is very eager to impress upon the mind some connection with his externally derived prayer regimen, and so would have the reader believe that fall on their faces is the value. While I render that way also in this edition, this point requires some elucidation. What it says is fall down to the chins. It does not even say fall down to their chins but: fall down to the chins. Thus to the chins is an adverbial modifier describing how \u2018they\u2019 fall down. I do not believe that it is possible to fall down to the chins physically \u2014 at least not with any degree of naturalness or spontaneity. I am compelled therefore to regard to the chins as a non-physical (i.e. metaphorical) adverbial modifier (cf. English up to one\u2019s neck) and take it to mean without reservation, completely, most earnestly. This is in large measure what to fall on one\u2019s face means in English, and so it is acceptable on that basis \u2014 but care should be taken to protect oneself here from vulnerability to the Traditionalist\u2019s indefatigable efforts to insinuate his externally derived requirements into the mind.",131],[17,107,5,"5.

Some Traditionalists understand this statement as recognition of the (superior) and long-awaited prophethood of Mu\u1e25ammad by those of previous scriptures. But the preponderance of pan-textual data is dramatically against them. In fact, what is being referenced here is recognition of the truth of destruction of communities by God in the past, and the inevitability of the Day of Judgment. The word rendered promise here (Arabic: wa\u02bfd) occurs 49 times (3:152, 4:122, 9:111, 10:4, 10:48, 10:55, 11:45, 11:65, 13:31, 14:22, 14:47, 16:38, 17:5, 17:5, 17:7, 17:104, 17:108, 18:21, 18:98, 18:98, 19:54, 19:61, 20:86, 21:9, 21:38, 21:97, 21:104, 22:47, 25:16, 27:71, 28:13, 28:61, 30:6, 30:6, 30:60, 31:9, 31:33, 34:29, 35:5, 36:48, 39:20, 39:74, 40:55, 40:77, 45:32, 46:16, 46:17, 67:25, 73:18). As used in the Qur\u2019an with regard to God it treats of three circumstances: God\u2019s promises to the believers regarding this life; God\u2019s promises both to believers and others regarding the reality of the Last Day and the Hereafter; of temporal destruction to come. Even the promise at 9:111 which references former scripture has the Day of Judgment firmly in view. And at 20:86, in the case of M\u016bs\u0101, the promise mentioned refers back to verses 20:81-82 which treat of both blessings and potential wrath. Anyone who thinks that 40:55 does not fit into this scheme should read the whole of that chapter. Thus, the preponderance of evidence based on the Qur\u2019anic data for the meaning of 17:108 is that those speaking here recognise the reality of God\u2019s promise to mankind: Judgment is coming. This reading is entirely consonant with the context here also. And at 73:18, where we find the last instance of wa\u02bfd the final word of that verse mirrors the concluding word of 17:108 (Arabic: maf\u02bf\u016blan \u2014 fulfilled). Any reader studious enough to have absorbed my work on \u2018the mysterious letters\u2019 will have understood that s\u016brah 73 itself contains the key to the division of the reading of the latter portion of the Qur\u2019an into segments as a warning to men. See Article MLQ. See also my work The God Protocol.",76],[17,109,1,"1. See note to 17:107.",28],[17,110,1,"1. Arabic: ra\u1e25m\u0101n. Typically rendered most merciful. See 36:23 and note thereto, note to 1:1, and Notepad I.",48],[17,110,2,"2. Arabic: \u1e63al\u0101t; i.e. such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3 and Article SZC. Generically, \u1e63al\u0101t denotes duty. In its primary sense it is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement at 1:5 forms our part \u2014 commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every man has to acknowledge God\u2019s authority (see 7:172). Worship \u2014 which is the value the Traditionalist insists upon here \u2014 is, doubtless, a duty; however, see 17:78 and note thereto. In the context here, the duty referred to is most readily identified in communication of the statements the recipient of the Qur\u2019an is given to say at 17:107-111. If this assertion is rejected, the fact is that \u2014 even given the Traditionalist\u2019s understanding here \u2014 the value at the opening of this verse cannot be what he claims for al \u1e63al\u0101t. His conflation of two concepts is particularly effective in English, the speakers of which he has believing something he himself knows to be untrue: that al \u1e63al\u0101t (as he understands it) and supplication (i.e. an appeal to God for something) are basically the same thing. This has worked because he has told the English-speaking world that al \u1e63al\u0101t means prayer, and the mind of the English speaker provided the bridge from that assertion to what he \u2014 the native speaker of English \u2014 means by the term, (i.e. supplication). But supplication is not what the Traditionalist means across the whole of this verse. In the present context \u2014 even given the Traditionalist\u2019s understanding of it \u2014 the opening subject of the verse is supplication and not a daily ritual which the Traditionalist thinks of as al \u1e63al\u0101t and which he has told the English speaker is prayer. So, even if one agrees with the Traditionalist\u2019s understanding of al \u1e63al\u0101t and with his view that the opening of the verse treats of supplication, this in no way suggests that these two processes are one thing, nor does it mean that this one thing is what the English speaker means by prayer. The Traditionalist \u2014 at least one with access to Arabic \u2014 knows all of this, but he allows the English speaker to labour under the misapprehension I have just summarised.",147],[17,111,1,"1.

It is perhaps significant that the calumny brought by many Christians over the centuries against God is mentioned at this point, just prior to the story of the companions of the cave (or The Seven Sleepers as Christian sources put it). Modern Christians typically have the impression that all early Christians were Trinitarians, but this is simply not the case; the first Christians were Judaeans and uncompromising monotheists. There certainly exists a story in a cave featuring Christians and set in Ephesus which predates the Qur\u2019an, and the fact that the Qur\u2019an features stories which were previously known is presented by its detractors as grounds to question its veracity or to accuse it of imitation. Such a position gains some traction over ignorant and inattentive audiences. However, the fact is that the Qur\u2019an both confirms and corrects a wide range of narratives as part of its modus operandi. If one can fault the facts that it confirms or corrects, that is one thing. But to criticise a message which itself states that it repeats and corrects known accounts \u2014 for doing exactly that \u2014 is a cheap shot designed to give audiences which are unlikely ever to consider the Qur\u2019an\u2019s arguments in context the impression that they have reliable grounds to disregard the Qur\u2019anic revelation in toto. Where the Qur\u2019an performs this function it often states as much, as here at 18:13 \u2014 We narrate to thee their report with the truth. The implication is that other reports exist and are incorrect and that this one states things correctly. Any suggestion that the subjects of the current story were Trinitarian Christians is also implicitly corrected by the Qur\u2019an. For his part, the Traditionalist Muslim, in my opinion, misunderstands a crucial part of this story due to his pre-existing commitment to extraneously derived values. I provide extensive notes over the course of this particular narrative to explain why and how I think it is typically misread.",46],[18,5,1,"1. Or of him. While I neither agree with nor follow his assertion in my translation, I include Muhammad Asad\u2019s point here for interest: Most of the classical commentators (and, as far as I am aware, all the earlier translators of the Qur\u2019an) relate the pronoun in bihi to the assertion that \u201cGod has taken unto Himself a son\u201d, and hence take the phrase to mean, \u201cThey have no knowledge of it\u201d, i.e., no knowledge of such a happening. However, this interpretation is weak inasmuch as absence of knowledge does not necessarily imply an objective negation of the fact to which it relates. It is, therefore, obvious that bihi cannot signify \u201cof it\u201d: it signifies \u201cof Him\u201d, and relates to God. Hence, the phrase must be rendered as above - meaning that they who make such a preposterous claim have no real knowledge of Him, since they attribute to the Supreme Being something that is attributable only to created imperfect beings. This interpretation is supported, in an unequivocal manner, by Tabari and, as an alternative, by Baydawi.",31],[18,5,2,"2. Lit.: Great is (become).",68],[18,6,1,"1.

This anticipates the time when the companions of the cave should withdraw having warned the erring people.",68],[18,16,2,"2. Here again affair serves as a marker to clarify who is the subject throughout the narrative \u2014 namely the companions of the cave (see note to 18:10).",178],[18,16,3,"3. Arabic: mirfaq \u2014 facilities, anything conducive to ease and convenience.",199],[18,17,1,"1. Generally, this segment is placed in a hypothetical mood by translators (And thou mightest have seen the sun, etc.). However, since I both parse and render this segment as an aside in the literary present which reviews the past in the now, I am able to render literally.",15],[18,17,2,"2. This verse provides support, perhaps, for aspects of the Petra thesis \u2014 or, at least, the Petra pilgrimage thesis \u2014 as Petra is liberally peppered with caves. See Notepad XVI.",176],[18,17,3,"3. Arabic: \u0101y\u0101t. See Notepad VIII.",202],[18,17,4,"4. Cf. \u2018among Our proofs\u2019 (18:9).",211],[18,18,1,"1. I have rendered this clause and that preceding literally. Most translators render in a more hypothetical mood (And thou wouldst have thought them awake[...]). However, the plain reading is as I have rendered. With the segment beginning 18:17 as a parenthetical aside which treats of the present though with a view to the past \u2014 as I read the text \u2014 the sense here is: though thou think those around thee awake, they are, in fact, asleep \u2014 and there is nothing thou canst do to waken them. Thus a parallel is drawn between the narrative past and the narrative present (cf. 18:6).",104],[18,18,2,"2. The attentive reader will notice that the Qur\u2019an nowhere expresses repugnance towards dogs. The Traditionalist has imported his dislike of dogs from elsewhere (cf. 5:87), claiming them to be filthy. I would agree that wild dogs roaming the streets are a public nuisance requiring effective remedy. But a good, properly trained dog (with a responsible master) is a blessing, providing man with companionship and protection, and invaluable assistance to him in his work.",120],[18,18,3,"3. At this point, the text genuinely adopts the hypothetical mood (Arabic: law) which other translators begin at 18:17.",183],[18,19,1,"1. The stage has been set for the focus of the narrative: the debate which ensues once the companions of the cave have awoken. I emphasise this because the Traditionalist loses this thread, and much of the remaining notes I provide on this part of this s\u016brah are dedicated to ensuring that we do not lose it.",67],[18,19,2,"2. Arabic: waraq. Typically translated silver coin. I do not say this is wrong, but I failed to find any support for silver, though it exists in the broader literature. The original sense of waraq is leaf (of a tree). It also means strip of metal and is used to mean coin or coinage. So coin is a safe value here in the circumstances.",276],[18,21,1,"1. It is at this point that the Traditionalist\u2019s understanding, in my view, falls apart \u2014 and does so for reasons of ideology (namely, that he has imported extraneous values which he both needs and assumes as part of the persistent fallacy which has it that his religion grows organically out of the Qur\u2019an). In the notes that follow, I unpick the numerous errors he makes, to explain what this verse means. However, before embarking on that process, it is as well to understand what he says it means. The generally moderate Traditionalist translators at Saheeh International, for example, present in the following way: And similarly, We caused them to be found that they [who found them] would know that the promise of All\u0101h is truth and that of the Hour there is no doubt. [That was] when they(1) disputed among themselves about their affair and [then] said, \u201cConstruct over them a structure. Their Lord is most knowing about them.\u201d Said those who prevailed in the matter, \u201cWe will surely take [for ourselves] over them a masjid.\u201d (The reader will appreciate that everything in square brackets is admitted interpolation.) At (1) a note is supplied: The people of the city.",9],[18,21,2,"2. I.e. God.",17],[18,21,3,"3. Arabic: a\u02bfthara. The facts are these: the form IV verb a\u02bfthara + \u02bfal\u0101 means to acquaint, to make come across and requires two objects (e.g. x with y) and the typical rendering here fails this requirement, a point conceded indirectly by the lexicographer Lane (Arabic-English Lexicon, p. 2004) who describes the second object as \u2018suppressed\u2019. This is academic language for \u2018missing and ignored for reasons of convenience\u2019. (To illustrate, here is a sentence in English which has the same problem: we thought about. There is an obvious unmet requirement here. Popular renderings of the clause in question have the same type of problem.) The case is quite simple once we own the point which the Traditionalist is unable to grasp which is that the speaker here has not changed to God. It remains the companions of the cave (which should come as no surprise since we are told at 18:19 that the entire point of the story is the debate between the companions of the cave). The verb, then, is not in the first person plural (we), it is in the third person masculine singular (he) taking a first person plural object n\u0101 (us) then the preposition \u02bfal\u0101 and the second object them. The companions of the cave are here stating why God acquainted them with the people of the town. In his haste to create a religion based on later fictions, the Traditionalist has lost \u2014 or perhaps wished not to retain \u2014 the point of the Qur\u2019anic narrative which is that we, the believers, are meant to warn those around us. It is not a job for commissioned messengers and prophets only; such a task is what following a messenger of God entails. The companions of the cave were simply doing their job; and their story concentrates on the post-op review in the cave. Understood thus, all requirements of the verb are met and nothing is \u2018suppressed\u2019, and we remain focused on the very point the Qur\u2019an tells us is central: the debate among the companions of the cave (18:19).",41],[18,21,4,"4. I.e. the people to whom the companions of the cave witnessed (see 18:14). The expression promise of God treats of the warning to a community of destruction (for a detailed outline of this collocation see note to 17:108).",52],[18,21,5,"5. Arabic: \u1e25aqqun. See Notepad XVII (\u1e25aqq- vi.).",97],[18,21,6,"6. This, perhaps, also refers back to the initial When in this story at 18:10 confirming that this is a continuation of that story given to correct the assumption introduced at 18:9. Here, as elsewhere, one needs to develop a sense of the shorthand and logistics the Qur\u2019an employs. To use screenwriting terminology, what we have here is the payoff for the setup at 18:19 (when the companions of the cave send one of their number with money to buy food). That person has now, evidently, returned with news of what has transpired on the ground while they were asleep. We are left to fill in the details. The executive version is this: they have been in stasis for an inordinately long time (cf. 18:26); everyone who persecuted them (and by extension, all the members of their personal families along with everyone else they knew) is now long dead, and they are living in a completely different era. Put yourself in their shoes: if you woke up one day and someone in your house went to the shops and came back with a similar piece of news, would that not cause voices to be raised?",157],[18,21,7,"7. I.e. the companions of the cave.",163],[18,21,8,"8. Here again affair serves as a marker to identify the subject throughout the narrative: the companions of the cave (see note to 18:10). The Traditionalist here switches affair to reference the people of the city and is, in general, lost in his understanding of the entire passage.",211],[18,21,9,"9. I.e. over \u2014 or in memory of \u2014 those who perished. The argument here is in favour of a monument or memorial building of some type. Muhammad Asad covers this sense in his rendering of this clause: Indeed, we must surely raise a house of worship in their memory!",245],[18,21,10,"10. The victors in the debate conclude that they will take a masjid for (i.e. as a recompense for) them. The Qur\u2019anic usage of the Arabic provides a construction which occurs just once more in the text (at the end of 18:77) where take (in payment) for is unquestionably the sense (and confirmed to be so by the generality of translators). Interestingly, a Christian church was built at Petra in 450 CE. The Traditionalist\u2019s rendering of the current phrase here is typically mired in fudging and surmise.",366],[18,21,11,"11. Arabic: masjid, mas\u0101jid. See Notepad VII.i. A rigorous pan-textual approach is embarrassing to the Traditionalist here also. In his general presentation, he allows the non-specialist reader to think that by masjid the Qur\u2019an means an Islamic mosque. Awkwardly for him, context (as here) frequently demonstrates this claim to be false. In such cases, he unblushingly inserts another value and hopes no one will notice \u2014 which generally nobody does.",389],[18,22,1,"1. I.e. those who speculate without knowledge.",4],[18,22,2,"2. This, incidentally, is the number surmised by early Christians.",163],[18,22,3,"3. Given the statement at 18:25 there is a case to be made that this refers to the number of years the companions of the cave slept rather than the number of individual youths, but God knows best.",244],[18,22,4,"4. I.e. one based in and limited to what God has given. The facts are these: a population fell into idolatry; young men of faith refused to go along with that idolatry and stood up and witnessed to the truth of the One God, and were rejected; God protected the young men a stasis of sleep in a cave for an inordinately long time (cf. 18:26); the young men awoke to find that God had destroyed the former population; the young men discovered what had transpired and discussed how best they should respond; one party argued that they should build a monument to those who had perished; a second party argued that they should take a masjid (place of worship) in recompense for the people of the community to which they witnessed (and sent to their lord apprised of the truth).",336],[18,22,5,"5. The Qur\u2019an is completely clear: we are to limit our information about this question to facts (which, for us, means what we have in the Qur\u2019an).",399],[18,24,1,"1. Surely, the point of this aside is that one should anticipate that he, like the companions of the cave, if he would serve God and do what is required (namely, warn with the revelation the erring culture around him), may also sleep for an unnaturally long time, or be taken to his Lord in death \u2014 which is why it is a wise course to anticipate such an eventuality by referencing God\u2019s will as part of formulating any future plans.",21],[18,25,1,"1. I take this verse to refer to those who guess at the Unseen (cf. 18:22).

Yet, in other contexts, the Traditionalist foists upon the believer a fixed tax which not only is nowhere found in the Qur\u2019an, but the notion of which is antithetical to plain Qur\u2019anic statements (2:215, 2:219).",91],[18,82,1,"1. See note to 4:2.",51],[18,83,1,"1. Lit.: He of the Two Horns or He of the Two Generations. Muhammad Asad contributes the following thoughts here: Lit., \u201cI will convey unto you a remembrance [or \u201cmention\u201d] of him\u201d - i.e., something that is worthy of remembrance and mention: which, I believe, is an allusion to the parabolic character of the subsequent story and the fact that it is confined, like the preceding parable of Moses and the unknown sage, to a few fundamental, spiritual truths. - The epithet Dhu\u2019l-Qarnayn signifies \u201cthe Two-Horned One\u201d or \u201cHe of the Two Epochs\u201d, since the noun qarn has the meaning of \u201chorn\u201d as well as of \u201cgeneration\u201d or \u201cepoch\u201d or \u201cage\u201d or \u201ccentury\u201d. The classical commentators incline to the first of these meanings (\u201cthe Two-Horned\u201d); and in this they appear to have been influenced by the ancient Middle-Eastern imagery of \u201chorns\u201d as symbols of power and greatness, although the Qur\u2019an itself does not offer any warrant for this interpretation. In fact, the term qarn (and its plural qurun) occurs in the Qur\u2019an - apart from the combination Dhu\u2019l-Qarnayn appearing in verses 83, 86 and 94 of this surah - twenty times: and each time it has the meaning of \u201cgeneration\u201d in the sense of people belonging to one particular epoch or civilization. However, since the allegory of Dhu\u2019l-Qarnayn is meant to illustrate the qualities of a powerful and just ruler, it is possible to assume that this designation is an echo of the above-mentioned ancient symbolism, which - being familiar to the Arabs from very early times - had acquired idiomatic currency in their language long before the advent of Islam. Within the context of our Qur\u2019anic allegory, the \u201ctwo horns\u201d may be taken to denote the two sources of power with which Dhu\u2019l-Qarnayn is said to have been endowed: namely, the worldly might and prestige of kingship as well as the spiritual strength resulting from his faith in God. This last point is extremely important - for it is precisely the Qur\u2019anic stress on his faith in God that makes it impossible to identify Dhu \u2018l-Qarnayn, as most of the commentators do, with Alexander the Great (who is represented on some of his coins with two horns on his head) or with one or another of the pre-Islamic, Himyaritic kings of Yemen. All those historic personages were pagans and worshipped a plurality of deities as a matter of course, whereas our Dhu \u2018l-Qarnayn is depicted as a firm believer in the One God: indeed, it is this aspect of his personality that provides the innermost reason of the Qur\u2019anic allegory.

The word kadh\u0101lika means thus and occurs many times in the Qur\u2019an. In the majority of cases it fits perfectly within the narrative. However, I noticed that in a small number of cases it neither fits fully syntactically nor has any obvious function. Translators struggle to accommodate it in such cases by ignoring it, twisting it, or inserting words of their own choosing to form a non-existent and non-functioning thought such as: thus [it was] or thus [it came to pass], treating the reader to the literary equivalent of ho-hum or well then \u2014 certainly not representative of the terse and compact vitality which one experiences with the Qur\u2019an. I reviewed and listed every instance of kadh\u0101lika and identified those cases in which they \u2018hang\u2019 (or seem lost or disjointed from the context). That process rendered a set comprising: 18:91, 26:59, 44:28, 44:54. (The reader is encouraged to look at and compare a number of translations to see how the translators wrestle to make the word fit; where they deal with it honestly it lies there like a second spare tyre next to a fully packed car.) Having identified the set, I read the surrounding context for each and found that they all treat of the same themes: security in, and inheritance or possession of, land or kingdom. In order: 18:91 treats of Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn who encounters a people who have nothing but the sun above their heads (they have neither security nor possession of the land) and in the next verse the narrative turns to the story of Ya\u2019j\u016bj and Ma\u2019j\u016bj due to whom those he encounters are unable to live unmolested in the land \u2014 which condition he remedies (they possess a land but have not security \u2014 although they gain it); at 26:59 the children of Israel inherit \u2018treasures and a noble station\u2019 and are delivered through the sea (leaving behind slavery and tyranny) while those who oppressed them are destroyed (so the children of Israel had neither security nor possession but they gain both along with inheritance); 44:28 treats of Fir\u02bfawn and his people and lists the good that they had, before stating: \u2018[...]We gave it as an inheritance to another people\u2019 and \u2018[...]the heaven and the earth wept not for them, nor were they granted respite\u2019 (so they had both security and possession but lost everything and utterly failed in the end); the final instance is found at 44:54 and treats of those of prudent fear, and sits in the middle of 44:51-57, a passage which describes the bliss of the Garden where the inhabitants are \u2018in a secure station\u2019 and will \u2018not taste therein of death save the former death[...]\u2019 \u2014 a passage which itself follows on from, and stands in stark contradistinction to, a description of the fate of the inhabitants of Hell (so in this case they have the supreme security and possession, and can never lose it). Given the totality of the above facts, I must regard these \u2018extra\u2019 kadh\u0101likas as having logistical as well as semantic functions, operating with a function similar to kall\u0101 (see note to 74:16) as pan-textual markers which draw together points spread across the broader narrative \u2014 a fact which indicates that their surrounding contexts should be considered together. Given what we now know, the statement immediately following the first instance of this kadh\u0101lika set at 18:91 takes on an entirely different aspect. Translators struggle to dispatch this instance with conviction because they (quite reasonably) assume it treats of Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn, and when understood as such it means, frankly, nothing \u2014 or at least nothing we can do anything with. However, it fits perfectly into the model just outlined. Saheeh International renders the clause: \u2018And We had encompassed [all] that he had in knowledge.\u2019 The Arabic rendered here he had is ladayhi which means (in the context) he has (or he had) with him or near him is (or was). The case is now clear that the statement refers not to Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn but to the use of the hanging kadh\u0101lika: And We have encompassed all that it (i.e. the hanging kadh\u0101lika) has (i.e. is with it, near it) in knowledge. All instances appear in the notes and reference this verse. This is one of the proofs the Qur\u2019an contains which demonstrate that it is complete, perfect, and in the correct order (see also note to 74:31 and Article MLQ).",5],[18,91,2,"2.

There is no justification that I can find for Traditionalist translations here using mountains and synonyms. This noun occurs only once, a fact which makes it vulnerable to abuse for the usual reasons. The verb form occurs at 6:46, 6:157, 6:157, 6:157 and means to turn away (in a reflexive, not transitive sense). The story here, as commonly understood, is that a wall was built between two mountains to keep Ya\u2019j\u016bj and Ma\u2019j\u016bj at bay. But I do not agree that this is what the text says. Rather, it seems to be yet another case of ideology driving interpretation. There are strong, internally verifiable words for mountain in the Qur\u2019an but \u1e63adaf is not one of them; such a value also makes no sense in the context: if a wall is erected across a valley and there exists a compelling reason to get past it, it is a simple matter to climb up one side of the mountain and down the other side of the barrier. In any case, I do not believe this is what is described here. The preceding language concerns building a dam, filling until making level and pouring. This does not sound like building upwards, rather blocking downwards or inwards. My thesis is this: Ya\u2019j\u016bj and Ma\u2019j\u016bj were cave-dwellers and Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn is blocking the entrance to their subterranean domain. In such a scenario \u1e63adaf bears a reasonable correlation to the action in both its noun and verb aspects. The verb means to turn away, which is what cave-dwellers have traditionally done with regard to the world. The noun\u2019s meanings have in common the concept of an aperture or opening which serves as an entrance to something which itself burrows into the inner parts of a thing. On this basis, I believe that opening is the right interpretation here. In this scenario, Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn is not building a wall between one faction and another. He is sealing Ya\u2019j\u016bj and Ma\u2019j\u016bj alive into a mass tomb. On this basis verses 18:98-99 make sense also. Creative eschatological myths concerning the Ya\u2019j\u016bj and Ma\u2019j\u016bj are now superfluous \u2014 or, at least they can claim no Qur\u2019anic basis.",75],[18,96,3,"3.

Cf. 7:143, 69:14, 89:21 which are the only remaining verses in which words from this root (d-k-k) occur in the Qur\u2019an. A review of these verses will confirm that what is meant here is the Day in which God Almighty arises. The point Dh\u016bl-Qarnayn is making is that the tomb they have created for Ya\u2019j\u016bj and Ma\u2019j\u016bj will not withstand the end of the world, and that Ya\u2019j\u016bj and Ma\u2019j\u016bj, like every other creature, will be brought forth to Judgment; he is simply putting the work of his hands into right context with respect to the power and judgment of God. This narrative has been woven into an eschatological expectation by Muslims, the broader scope of which is entirely contrary to clear statements in the Qur\u2019an.

Thus, scrupulous performance of a ritual, in and of itself, can have no material bearing on what is meant here. However, our value for al \u1e63al\u0101t (duty) holds firm. Duty is that which one does whether one feels like doing it or not. Duty keeps one from following one\u2019s lusts. Certainly, it is a duty upon a believer to worship God.

This parabolic \u201csaying\u201d of the unbelievers implies, in the garb of a rhetorical question, a superficially plausible but intrinsically fallacious argument in favour of a society which refuses to submit to any absolute moral imperatives and is determined to obey the dictates of expediency alone. In such a social order, material success and power are usually seen as consequences of a more or less conscious rejection of all metaphysical considerations - and, in particular, of all that is comprised in the concept of God-willed standards of morality - on the assumption that they are but an obstacle in the path of man\u2019s free, unlimited \u201cdevelopment\u201d. It goes without saying that this attitude (which has reached its epitome in the modern statement that \u201creligion is opium for the people\u201d) is diametrically opposed to the demand, voiced by every higher religion, that man\u2019s social life, if it is to be a truly \u201cgood\u201d life, must be subordinated to definite ethical principles and restraints. By their very nature, these restraints inhibit the unprincipled power-drive which dominates the more materialistic societies and enables them to achieve - without regard to the damage done to others and, spiritually, to themselves - outward comforts and positions of strength in the shortest possible time: but precisely because they do act as a brake on man\u2019s selfishness and power-hunger, it is these moral considerations and restraints - and they alone - that can free a community from the interminable, self-destructive inner tensions and frustrations to which materialistic societies are subject, and thus bring about a more enduring, because more organic, state of social well-being[...].",190],[19,75,1,"1.

But whereas verse 81 refers specifically to the godless who accord a quasi-divine status to material wealth and power and abandon themselves entirely to the pursuit of worldly success, the present passage refers to people who, while believing in God, deify prophets and saints, too, in the subconscious hope that they might act as \u201cmediators\u201d between them and the Almighty. Since this deification offends against the principle of God\u2019s transcendent oneness and uniqueness, it implies a breach of man\u2019s \u201cbond with God\u201d and, if consciously persisted in, constitutes an unforgivable sin (cf. 4:48 and 116).",46],[19,89,1,"1.

However, what is missing from such a rendering, and what I detect in the Arabic, is an allusion to the Christian practice of making supplication to God in the name of his \u2018son\u2019.",19],[19,91,2,"2.

Muhammad Asad comments here: The idea that God might have a \u201cson\u201d - either in the real or in the metaphorical sense of this term - would presuppose a degree of innate likeness between \u201cthe father\u201d and \u201cthe son\u201d: but God is in every respect unique, so that \u201cthere is nothing like unto Him\u201d (42:11) and \u201cnothing that could be compared with Him\u201d (112:4). Moreover, the concept of \u201cprogeny\u201d implies an organic continuation of the progenitor, or of part of him, in another being and, therefore, presupposes a degree of incompleteness before the act of procreation (or incarnation, if the term \u201csonship\u201d is used metaphorically): and the idea of incompleteness, in whatever sense, negates the very concept of God. But even if the idea of \u201csonship\u201d is meant to express no more than one of the different \u201caspects\u201d of the One Deity (as is claimed in the Christian dogma of the \u201cTrinity\u201d), it is described in the Qur\u2019an as blasphemous inasmuch as it amounts to an attempt at defining Him who is \u201csublimely exalted above anything that men may devise by way of definition\u201d (see last sentence of 6:100).",48],[19,93,1,"1.

In this case \u2014 and in this case alone \u2014 the Almighty appoints love for us.

The fact is that this verse speaks of al \u1e63al\u0101t for My remembrance.

The problem, as ever, is that the Traditionalist over-specifies the general, and then injects the details from one case into all cases, drawing on an extraneous literature. By insisting on an over-specified value for aq\u0101ma al \u1e63al\u0101t, the result is that he imposes upon M\u016bs\u0101 a system of prayer that he never encountered, and misses the point of 20:15-16 in the context, and deprives the reader of making the obvious connection between this statement and 20:42.

Muhammad Asad contributes the following thought: According to Arab philologists, the term mann denotes not only the sweet, resinous substance exuded by certain plants of the desert, but also everything that is \u201cbestowed as a favour\u201d, i.e., without any effort on the part of the recipient. Similarly, the term salwa signifies not merely \u201ca quail\u201d or \u201cquails\u201d, but also \u201call that makes man content and happy after privation\u201d (Qamus). Hence the combination of these two terms denotes, metonymically, the gift of sustenance freely bestowed by God upon the followers of Moses.",168],[20,81,1,"1.

I do not necessarily agree with all of his thoughts here, but I include Muhammad Asad\u2019s comment with some light editing for interest: The designation as-samiri is undoubtedly an adjectival noun denoting the person\u2019s descent or origin. According to one of the explanations advanced by Tabari and Zamakhshari, it signifies \u201ca man of the Jewish clan of the Samirah\u201d, i.e., the ethnic and religious group designated in later times as the Samaritans (a small remnant of whom is still living in Nablus, in Palestine). Since that sect as such did not yet exist at the time of Moses, it is possible that - as Ibn \u2018Abbas maintained (Razi) - the person in question was one of the many Egyptians who had been converted to the faith of Moses and joined the Israelites on their exodus from Egypt: in which case the designation samiri might be connected with the ancient Egyptian shemer, \u201ca foreigner\u201d or \u201cstranger\u201d. This surmise is strengthened by his introduction of the worship of the golden calf, undoubtedly an echo of the Egyptian cult of Apis. In any case, it is not impossible that the latter-day Samaritans descended - or were reputed to descend - from this personality, whether of Hebrew or of Egyptian origin; this might partly explain the persistent antagonism between them and the rest of the Israelite community. Another line of reasoning identifies s\u0101miriyy with Zimr\u012b (Hebrew: \u05d6\u05b4\u05de\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9, lit. \u201cpraiseworthy\u201d) son of Salu, the prince or leader of a family within the Tribe of Simeon during the time of the Israelites\u2019 Exodus.",92],[20,86,1,"1. While I do not hold to this view myself, Muhammad Asad\u2019s comment here explains why some translators render otherwise: Or, according to Zamakhshari: \u201cDid, then, the time [of my absence] seem too long to you?\u201d (It is to be noted that the term \u2018ahd signifies a \u201ctime\u201d or \u201cperiod\u201d as well as a \u201ccovenant\u201d or \u201cpromise\u201d.)",155],[20,86,2,"2.

Muhammad Asad produces here what is for him unusually weak exegesis and moral interpretation. However, I include his comment since the broader points may be of interest to some students: It is mentioned in Exodus xii, 35 that, immediately before their departure from Egypt, the Israelites \u201cborrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver and jewels of gold\u201d. This \u201cborrowing\u201d was obviously done under false pretences, without any intention on the part of the Israelites to return the jewellery to its rightful owners: for, according to the Biblical statement (ibid., verse 36), \u201cthey spoiled [i.e., robbed] the Egyptians\u201d by doing so. While it is noteworthy that the Old Testament, in its present, corrupted form, does not condemn this behaviour, its iniquity seems to have gradually dawned upon the Israelites, and so they decided to get rid of those sinfully acquired ornaments (Baghawi, Zamakhshari and - in one of his alternative interpretations - Razi).",139],[20,87,4,"4.

While it can be claimed that this is a case of the prophetic past (a common characteristic of the Qur\u2019an: future events described in the past tense), the import surely pertains also to the narrative present. The verb here anticipates its corollary in the present s\u016brah at 21:97 and is found additionally at 7:185, 21:1, 54:1, 96:19. In the first four instances of the set it treats of an approaching Day (of Judgment or of Punishment) as either an impending or future event, while at 96:19 it is found in the imperative in a directive to the Messenger to draw near to God. The Messenger was expecting destruction and, according to my analysis, the place of his initial preaching was destroyed in an act of God (treated in detail in The God Protocol). See note to 54:1. We note also the progressing motif within the s\u016brah \u2014 kunn\u0101 f\u0101\u02bfil\u012bna \u2014 (found at 21:17, 21:79, 21:104) discussed in the note to 21:17.",10],[21,2,1,"1. Arabic: dhikr \u2014 calling to mind, recalling, reminding; remembrance (of something past); history. This word is a feature of this s\u016brah (see notes to 21:1, 21:5, and 21:17 for comments on other characteristic features). This noun occurs 76 times in the text, and the present s\u016brah contains 10 of those instances (21:2, 21:7, 21:10, 21:24, 21:24, 21:36, 21:42, 21:48, 21:50, 21:105), more than any other s\u016brah (the nearest competitors are s\u016brah 38 with six instances, and s\u016brah 54 with five). The disproportionate incidence of this common word in the s\u016brah perhaps signals that we should pay it particular attention. The Traditionalist chooses to understand dhikr to mean the entire Qur\u2019an on an ad hoc basis where it suits his purposes (and in the present s\u016brah he requires that value at 21:24, 21:24, 21:50). While in places dhikr does have that meaning (in the sense that the Qur\u2019an as a whole is a remembrance) \u2014 in others it does not, a point which the Traditionalist not only concedes, but actively demonstrates in his translations. The question here is whether this is the sense which it conveys in the places the Traditionalist ascribes it this value in this s\u016brah (21:24, 21:24, 21:50). It will become clear as we progress through the s\u016brah that the Traditionalist needs to ascribe a value of the entire Qur\u2019an to this word in the places mentioned, for without it his services as the supplier of \u2018additional\u2019 and \u2018explanatory\u2019 literatures are made void. Each instance of dhikr in this chapter references this verse. Cf. 21:10 and note thereto.",14],[21,3,1,"1. Lit.: the.",61],[21,3,2,"2. Arabic: h\u0101dh\u0101 \u2014 this. This word plays a role in the present s\u016brah as we shall see. At 21:24 and 21:50, the Traditionalist claims for it a value for which he cannot provide genuine support (i.e. that of the Qur\u2019an as a whole). We note that outside the two instances mentioned, where h\u0101dh\u0101 occurs (21:3, 21:36, 21:38, 21:59, 21:62, 21:63, 21:97, 21:103) it is perfectly clear what it refers to, and in each case it is to something localised (a named or known individual, a specific event, or something immediately present). The exception is 21:106 where the collocation is f\u012b h\u0101dh\u0101, the significance of which is known (see note to 22:78). Thus, on the basis of the textual evidence pertaining to h\u0101dh\u0101 in the s\u016brah, in the cases mentioned above (21:24, 21:50), absent exceptional evidence, their values should be taken to refer to the text immediately surrounding each instance, and not to the Qur\u2019an as a whole as implied by the Traditionalist. In the case of 21:50, unlike the Traditionalist, we can provide exceptional evidence to show that the entire Qur\u2019an is meant (see note to 6:92). In the case of 21:24 we cannot, and therefore must revert in that instance to the dominant (localised) value h\u0101dh\u0101 has in the s\u016brah.",93],[21,3,3,"3. Arabic: si\u1e25r \u2014 sorcery.

In my opinion, the matrix system of today is sorcery in the sense that the Qur\u2019an uses the term. Much of what purports to be science, education, and entertainment makes sense only when understood in terms of occult magic (for example: use of symbol, number, astrology, and visible allusions to ancient cults). The cult of government is today a form of sorcery (or mind control), one which has achieved the status of a god, and rivals the cults of ancient Egypt, Rome, or Nazi Germany. Underpinning it are brute force, smoke, mirrors, and demonic powers.

Cf. 27:54.",159],[21,4,1,"1. Or He said. While Muhammad Asad appeals here to some authorities I may not rate exactly as does he, his comment covers a point which should be known by the serious student of the text: According to the earliest scholars of Medina and Basrah, as well as some of the scholars of Kufah, this word is spelt qul, as an imperative (\u201cSay\u201d), whereas some of the Meccan scholars and the majority of those of Kufah read it as qala (\u201cHe [i.e., the Prophet] said\u201d). In the earliest copies of the Qur\u2019an the spelling was apparently confined, in this instance, to the consonants q-l: hence the possibility of reading it either as qul or as qala. However, as Tabari points out, both these readings have the same meaning and are, therefore, equally valid, \u201cfor, when God bade Muhammad to say this, he [undoubtedly] said it... Hence, in whichever way this word is read, the reader is correct (musib as-sawab) in his reading.\u201d Among the classical commentators, Baghawi and Baydawi explicitly use the spelling qul, while Zamakhshari\u2019s short remark that \u201cit has also been read as qala\u201d seems to indicate his own preference for the imperative qul. The topic here is suggestive of a much larger one: that the diacritical adornment to the \u1e25ur\u016bf (letters) are in places interpretive, and may be contested on the basis of context or common sense (cf. 39:18). I argue a thematically related point on the basis of pan-textual analysis at my note to 9:28.",9],[21,4,2,"2. Lit.: the word or the utterance. Arabic: qawl \u2014 speech; teaching, doctrine. Cf. 22:24, 22:30, 23:68, 51:8.",38],[21,5,1,"1. Arabic: bal. See note to 2:88. This verse presents three of the commonest arguments against the Qur\u2019an: 1. That the Qur\u2019an is a disjointed narrative which makes no sense. 2. That Mu\u1e25ammad invented it. 3. That Mu\u1e25ammad was a poet (and that the Qur\u2019an is his composition). We note here that certain s\u016brahs contain what one might call characteristic mechanisms; that is, particular chapters use turns of phrase or individual words or constructions in ways which are conspicuous, including to an extent which is noticeable because it is disproportionate. In the present s\u016brah, such a characteristic mechanism is the use of bal (rendered variously throughout the text, as per the note to 2:88, it is found in this verse as But) since it occurs 12 times \u2014 more than in any other s\u016brah. (For comparison: bal occurs a total of 127 times in the Qur\u2019an, of which seven are in al baqarah \u2014 the longest s\u016brah). We discern a clear argument and progression in the present chapter marked by bal: rejections and refutations advanced by those who mock and reject the Messenger; the establishment of truth; a mocking of the idolaters themselves; and, finally, the wrongdoers\u2019 recognition of their heedlessness as they face eternity in Hell: 21:5, 21:5, 21:5, 21:18, 21:24, 21:26, 21:40, 21:42, 21:44, 21:56, 21:63, 21:97.

Arabic: dhikr \u2014 calling to mind, recalling, reminding; remembrance (of something past); history. The Traditionalist understands this to indicate those who hold to the Bible (i.e. those called Jews and Christians today). While I accept this view to an extent, I lament that its point has been lost, which is that their scriptures contain histories. The expression \u2018people of the remembrance\u2019 occurs at only one other place in the Qur\u2019an (16:43). See note to 21:2.",94],[21,10,1,"1. Arabic: kit\u0101b. See Notepad IX.iii.",31],[21,10,2,"2. Arabic: dhikr \u2014 calling to mind, recalling, reminding; remembrance (of something past); history. The Qur\u2019an contains a history of the community of the Prophet (albeit in thumbnail outline); and this is the point here: this tells your own history. It is clear from the broader narrative that impending destruction loomed large on the horizon, and that the destruction of previous communities was a principal driver informing the mission of the time. When we assemble key features of the history of that mission on the basis of the text, it is clear that the original community to which Muhammad preached was itself annihilated (see my work The God Protocol). Those who today claim stewardship over the history of the period have a narrative, but that narrative does not work outwards from the Qur\u2019an on the basis of its contents; rather, it works inwards to it on the basis of ideological requirements and conclusions taken from elsewhere as part of the larger project of making the Qur\u2019an seem to contain a religion which, in truth, it does not. The mental energy required to ignore the obvious conflicts between that religion\u2019s narrative and what is contained in the book it claims as its foundational scripture is the price of membership of the religion, and its dominance over normative mental faculties and standards of investigation regarded as piety by its adherents. Naturally, Muslims have declined intellectually and culturally in consequence. The Qur\u2019an seems to anticipate this result, with the remainder of the verse indicating the solution.

The core of this formula (kunn\u0101 f\u0101\u02bfil\u012bna) comprises a repeating \u2014 and developing \u2014 motif within this s\u016brah (and occurs only within this s\u016brah). This formula resists translation into English in a manner which is both consistent and natural across each of its three instances (21:17, 21:79, 21:104), as the context is different in each case. The full import of the core of this formula might be allowed a freer rendition into English as: We are ever (or were ever) doers [of what We will]. This is the sense. So what is meant here by developing motif? We mean that while the core of the formula (kunn\u0101 f\u0101\u02bfil\u012bna) remains fixed, the word linking it to the main text is different in each case, and this variance effects a development of the motif. So here at 21:17 the joining word is if (Arabic: in); at 21:79 it is and (Arabic: wa); and at 21:104 it is truly or indeed (Arabic: inn\u0101). Thus, the motif goes from conveying the conditional (if x be the case), to the enumerative (and x is the case), to the emphatic (truly x is the case). As a result, this motif grows in significance as we progress through the s\u016brah. To lose this formula in the process of translation is to deprive the reader of the s\u016brah of its chorus. While I can see no alternative to rendering this phrase in this somewhat wooden manner in order to achieve the consistency in English which is there in the Arabic, the price, it is hoped, is worth it.

This is the Arabic equivalent of or and, as in English, introduces the second part of an alternative question (e.g. Would you like tea or coffee?). However, here and in many places across the text, am exists without a contextual setup or corollary (e.g. Or coffee?). Clearly, this does not fully make sense. The translators wriggle and try to explain, but not convincingly. Sometimes by sticking with or \u2014 or by replacing or ignoring it \u2014 they stumble upon sense because the surrounding text happens to fall kindly for them. But where they are true to their dominant premises they are left often with an awkward non sequitur. My process was this: I identified all cases of am in the text, placing them in one of two categories: those which perform the standard offices of or (e.g. Would you like tea or coffee?), and those which do not, those which have no natural preceding part (e.g. Or coffee?). This latter category I call the \u2018hanging am\u2019. Upon reviewing all cases of the hanging am it became clear that the fact that am exists also in this second state indicates not a deficiency, but rather the presence of a separate textual entity. The Traditionalist has failed to understand the point and purpose of the hanging am which is why, in part, his translation reads in such a stalling, faltering way where it occurs. Its function, however, is twofold: rhetorical and logistical. It is rhetorical in that it identifies a key claim or scenario prior to answering or clarifying that claim or scenario, operating like a Q&A sheet. Its logistical function consists in the fact that the hanging am operates as a marker, so that all such Q&As may readily be identified and drawn together, thus providing an illuminating study as well as a reference guide for fielding common questions. The entire set of hanging ams is found at 2:108, 2:133, 2:140, 2:214, 4:53, 4:54, 6:143, 6:144, 6:144, 9:16, 10:31, 10:38, 11:13, 11:35, 13:16, 13:33, 13:33, 18:9, 21:21, 21:24, 21:43, 23:68, 23:69, 23:70, 23:72, 24:50, 25:44, 27:60, 27:61, 27:62, 27:63, 27:64, 29:4, 30:35, 32:3, 34:8, 35:40, 35:40, 37:150, 37:156, 38:9, 38:10, 38:28, 38:28, 39:9, 39:43, 42:9, 42:21, 42:24, 43:16, 43:21, 43:79, 43:80, 45:21, 46:4, 46:8, 47:24, 47:29, 52:30, 52:32, 52:32, 52:33, 52:35, 52:35, 52:36, 52:37, 52:37, 52:38, 52:39, 52:40, 52:41, 52:42, 52:43, 53:24, 53:36, 54:43, 54:44, 67:20, 67:21, 68:37, 68:39, 68:41, 68:46, 68:47.

I.e. contains the history of the Messenger and those who accompanied him. The Traditionalist tends to be careful to deflect the attention from the obvious import of this line and the one following, since if he allows dhikr its plain value, he places his later \u2018histories\u2019 in opposition with the Qur\u2019an. He can\u2019t allow that since he both claims the Qur\u2019an as his foundational scripture and needs the perception that the Qur\u2019an comports with his non-Qur\u2019anic sources. Unless he can appear to sit astride these divergent horses both he and his religion lose all credibility. The Traditionalist translators at Saheeh International, for example, offer here: This [Qur\u2019\u0101n] is the message for those with me and the message of those before me (supported by a note which reads: All previous prophets called for the worship of All\u0101h alone.)Meanwhile, non-traditionalist A. J. Arberry (who generally takes a literal approach within the bounds of his understanding) renders: This is the Remembrance of him who is with me, and the Remembrance of those before me. Whether what is meant by This in the context \u2014 the entire Qur\u2019an or some part thereof \u2014 is almost irrelevant to the inescapable conclusion which is that it is the Qur\u2019an which contains said remembrance (and not some other source). But that does not suit the Traditionalist. He both needs the Qur\u2019an to be from God but also to be in some vague way deficient, and therefore in need of both his sources and services. The reader is encouraged to consider all instances of dhikr in the present s\u016brah (listed at note to 21:2) for a broader appreciation of the word and its function.

For why this plain reading is inconvenient to the Traditionalist, see note to the present verse above. The word remembrance (dhikr) indicates in many cases what we would call today history. We note that the Qur\u2019an both covers what was (at the time of the revelation) current events, as well as what was for the people of that time (and for us today, naturally) history proper. Now, of course, the two are merged for us into one. This is a concept the Traditionalist seems unable to process. The battles, dramas, and religious requirements of those in previous times (including those of the Messenger and those with him) pertained to those people \u2014 although with lessons for us. What we need today for the business of knowing God\u2019s will and doing it is found within the Qur\u2019an and requires no supplementation. And to proceed on any other basis requires one to be honest and reject the Qur\u2019an\u2019s divine authority, since to regard it as deficient is to reject it in toto.

That much granted, one can point out that while under \u2018scientific\u2019 orthodoxy the moon makes \u2018a circuit\u2019 (although, correctly speaking, never in the same place twice), night and day do not make circuits of any kind (being merely functions of that side of the earth spinning upon its axis which faces the sun); meanwhile, the sun is said to make an orbit only through the Milky Way (of one cycle every 230 million years). However, under the pre-\u2018scientific\u2019 model (a flat, immovable earth above which the heavenly bodies progress), night and day also move in \u2018a circuit\u2019 (as the sun makes its daily, localised circuit above the surface of the earth it creates day, while night makes \u2018a circuit\u2019 also at and beyond the extent of the sun\u2019s limited reach across the earth\u2019s surface).",103],[21,35,1,"1.

However, the meaning can be derived by reference to key components within the statement. The words earth (ar\u1e0d) and to diminish (naqa\u1e0da) are found together outside 21:44 and 13:41 at one other place only: 50:4. There the subject is God\u2019s advance knowledge of the decaying process by which the earth will diminish the human body to nothing. If we consider this fact in combination with the statement at 53:32 that we humans were brought forth from the earth (Arabic: min al ar\u1e0d), then the allusion at 21:44 is seen to reference the inescapable corruption which awaits our physical body (cf. Dust thou art[...]). Moreover, the broader context here supports this interpretation (21:34-35 treat of mortality; 21:37 treats of man\u2019s creation; 21:39-40 treat of bodies in eternity; 21:44 opens by citing historical cases of mortality). Finally, the context (13:37-43) surrounding the only other instance of this formula at 13:41 has similar emphasis on mortality within the immovable fact of God\u2019s judgment.",175],[21,45,1,"1.

The Traditionalist translators at Saheeh International have a note here: These are three qualities of the Torah. While this assertion is plucked from the ether, its motivation is not: the Traditionalist is committed to keeping the reader as distant as possible from understanding dhikr as history or recalling (e.g. someone\u2019s deeds or characteristics), because of his underlying requirements (see notes to 21:2, 21:10, and 21:36.) In this context, dhikr surely refers to the mission of M\u016bs\u0101 and H\u0101r\u016bn to Fir\u02bfawn (cf. 20:14, 20:42).",81],[21,48,3,"3. See note to al muttaq\u016bn at 2:2.",109],[21,50,1,"1.

Arabic: al \u1e63al\u0101t; i.e. such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3 and Article SZC. Before discussing the nature of this instance of al \u1e63al\u0101t in the text, we will consider the dynamics of the verse overall. If we take the Traditionalist\u2019s own values as binding, the verse can only be tautologous. And, conversely, for the sense not be tautologous, the Traditionalist\u2019s values must be incorrect. To explain: the Traditionalist has it that al \u1e63al\u0101t is \u2018worship\u2019 (albeit worship of a very specific nature the details of which he derives from later hearsay ascribed to Mu\u1e25ammad, and insists upon as the Qur\u2019anic value); he also has it that \u02bfib\u0101da (here in a verbal form: \u2018they served us\u2019) is \u2018worship\u2019. And by \u2018worship\u2019 he means the same thing (at least to a large extent) as he means by al \u1e63al\u0101t. Therein lies a tautology. And even if we stretch the meaning of \u02bfib\u0101da to embrace the meaning given to it by later jurists (i.e. performance of the five pillars of a religion called Islam) and allow the last line to summarise what precedes, the Traditionalist is still in a bind because only two of his \u2018pillars\u2019 are present (and he can point nowhere in the Qur\u2019an at \u2018al khayr\u0101t\u2019 \u2014 good deeds \u2014 having a value equal to the missing three). Finally, if the Traditionalist attempts to wriggle out by citing a context that treats of pre-Islamic peoples, that move necessarily locks him out of his own claim (rejected vigorously by those who follow the Torah) that the \u2018pillars\u2019 of the Traditionalist\u2019s religion are materially the same thing as what was practised by the Hebrew followers of M\u016bs\u0101\u2019s Torah. We can summarise the narrative which precedes the point at which \u2018leaders\u2019 is mentioned in 21:73 as follows: 21:1-5 (impending destruction; heedlessness of men); 21:6-15 (former messengers; previous cases of destruction); 21:16-29 (absolute monotheism is reality); 21:30-33 (appeals to Creation); 21:34-40 (mortality of messenger; haste of man; reality of Hell); 21:41-47 (appeals to past, to death, and to Judgment). At this juncture mention of former believing notables begins: 21:48-50 (M\u016bs\u0101 and H\u0101r\u016bn: the Division; fear of the Hour); 21:51-70 (Ibr\u0101h\u012bm\u2019s witness to God alone against his people); 21:71 (L\u016b\u1e6d, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm\u2019s nephew); 21:72 (Is\u1e25\u0101q, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm\u2019s son, and Ya\u02bfq\u016bb, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm\u2019s grandson). The \u2018them\u2019 of 21:73 can only logically refer to these men \u2014 or to those which follow (see note to 21:24 for a full list). Yet nowhere in what precedes or follows this point in the present s\u016brah do we find support for the Traditionalist\u2019s values for al \u1e63al\u0101t (namely, performance of a five-time daily ritual) or for al zak\u0101t (payment of % yearly tax on one\u2019s substance). Rather, the emphasis in the sequence is on belief in God alone and the Last Day, and actions based thereupon (which is the core of our value for al \u1e63al\u0101t). Additionally, a central plank of the value we assert in this work for al zak\u0101t is the observance of legal sexual intercourse (purity) and we can point to the following in support of that value: L\u016b\u1e6d\u2019s mission was characterised by calling men away from sinful sexual behaviour (21:74-75); N\u016b\u1e25 (mentioned at 21:76) was victim of gross sexual misconduct, not the perpetrator of it (11:45-46); D\u0101w\u016bd fell sexually (according to the Hebrew scriptures; a point contested but unconvincingly so by the Traditionalist), mentioned here at 21:78 (which points to 38:17-26), but was chastened and improved as a result (Sulaym\u0101n himself was the legitimate fruit of his father\u2019s initially illegitimate union with his mother). We can point also to the sexual and general fidelity of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm (though sorely tested while awaiting offspring); likewise to that of Is\u1e25\u0101q (whose wife Rebecca did not conceive until later in life). Finally, we can point to Maryam whose defining characteristic in the Qur\u2019an is chastity (i.e. of eschewing immoral sexual activities \u2014 see 21:91 and note thereto). Thus, while one can argue on the basis of scripture that God instructed those listed in this s\u016brah in the upholding of duty (i.e. to cleave to and bear witness to God alone), and in the maintenance of (sexual) purity, it is simply not possible to assert that they kept the Traditionalist\u2019s prayer regimen or paid the tax he claims is obligatory. The Traditionalist\u2019s claims create dissonance and tautology, do not comport with what we find in the local context, find no support in the rest of the Qur\u2019an, and require the Traditionalist to accuse adherents of the Torah of possessing his values for al \u1e63al\u0101t and al zak\u0101t but hiding them. The underlying cause of all of this is the Traditionalist\u2019s duplication of the very sin he (rightly) criticises the Rabbinic Jews of: writing with his own hand stories he ascribes to a prophet of God. If we look to the Qur\u2019an rather than to the Traditionalist\u2019s \u2018Mishnah\u2019 for answers, this conflict evaporates.",123],[21,73,3,"3. Arabic: al zak\u0101t.

There are two general views on the meaning of dh\u016bl kifl each of which is presented below. Muhammad Asad\u2019s comment on this point follows with some light editing: Lit., \u201cand him of the pledge\u201d. The expression dhu \u2018l-kifl is derived from the verb kafala and especially the form takaffala - which signifies \u201che became responsible [for something or someone]\u201d or \u201cpledged himself [to do something]\u201d. Although the classical commentators consider dhu \u2018l-kifl to be the epithet or the proper name of a particular prophet - whom they variously, more or less at random, identify with Elijah or Joshua or Zachariah or Ezekiel - I fail to see any reason whatever for such attempts at \u201cidentification\u201d[...]. I am, therefore, of the opinion that we have here (as in the identical expression in 38:48) a generic term applying to every one of the prophets, inasmuch as each of them pledged himself unreservedly to God and accepted the responsibility for delivering His message to man. Abdullah Yusuf Ali takes the other (and more popular view), and I include his comment here for the sake of completion: Dhu al Kifl would literally mean \u201cpossessor of, or giving, a double requital or portion\u201d; or else, \u201cone who used a cloak of double thickness,\u201d that being one of the meanings of Kifl. The Commentators differ in opinion as to who is meant, why the title is applied to him, and the point of his being grouped with Ism\u0101\u2018\u012bl and Idris for constancy and patience. I think the best suggestion is that afforded by Karsten Niebuhr in his Reisebeschreibung nach Arabien, Copenhagen, 1778, 2:264-266, as quoted in the Encyclopaedia of Islam under \u201cDhu al Kifl\u201d. He visited Meshed \u2019Ah in Iraq, and also the little town called Kefil, midway between Najaf and Hillah (Babylon). Kefil, he says, is the Arabic form of Ezekiel. The shrine of Ezekiel was there, and the Jews came to it on a pilgrimage. If we accept \u201cDhu al Kifl\u201d to be not an epithet, but an Arabicised form of \u201cEzekiel\u201d, it fits the context. Ezekiel was a prophet in Israel who was carried away to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar after his second attack on Jerusalem (about B.C. 599). His Book is included in the English Bible (Old Testament). He was chained and bound, and put into prison, and for a time he was dumb, (Ezekiel, 3:25-26). He bore it all with patience and constancy, and continued to reprove boldly the evils in Israel. In a burning passage he denounces false leaders in words which are eternally true: \u201cWoe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flocks?

Abdullah Yusuf Ali\u2019s comment here follows with light editing: Dhu al Nun, \u201cthe man of the Fish or the Whale\u201d, is the title of Jonah (Yunus), because he was swallowed by a large Fish or Whale. He was the prophet raised to warn the Assyrian capital Nineveh[...] His story is told in 37:139-149. When his first warning was unheeded by the people, he denounced God\u2019s wrath on them. But they repented and God forgave them for the time being. Jonah, meanwhile, departed in wrath, discouraged at the apparent failure of his mission. He should have remained in the most discouraging circumstances, and relied on the power of God; for God had power both over Nineveh and over the Messenger He had sent to Nineveh. He went away to the sea and took a ship, but apparently the sailors threw him out as a man of bad omen in a storm. He was swallowed by a big Fish (or Whale), but in the depth of the darkness, he cried to God and confessed his weakness. The \u201cdarkness\u201d may be interpreted both physically and spiritually; physically, as the darkness of the night and the storm and the Fish\u2019s body; spiritually as the darkness in his soul, his extreme distress in the situation which he had brought on himself. God Most Gracious forgave him. He was cast out ashore; he was given the shelter of a plant in his state of physical and mental lassitude. He was refreshed and strengthened, and the work of his mission prospered. Thus he overcame all his disappointment by repentance and Faith, and God accepted him.",13],[21,87,2,"2.

Traditionalist translators are prone to insert mention of Jibr\u012bl into the text here, on the basis, I assume, of their non-Qur\u2019anic literature. The text on the page reads as non-sectarian A. J. Arberry, for example, renders: so We breathed into her of Our spirit. Muhammad Asad has an excellent note here: This allegorical expression, used here with reference to Mary\u2019s conception of Jesus, has been widely - and erroneously - interpreted as relating specifically to his birth. As a matter of fact, the Qur\u2019an uses the same expression in three other places with reference to the creation of man in general - namely in 15:29 and 38:72, \u201cwhen I have formed him... and breathed into him of My spirit\u201d; and in 32:9, \u201cand thereupon He forms [lit., \u201cformed\u201d] him fully and breathes lit., \u201cbreathed\u201d] into him of His spirit\u201d. In particular, the passage of which the last-quoted phrase is a part (i.e., 32:7-9) makes it abundantly and explicitly clear that God \u201cbreathes of His spirit\u201d into every human being. Commenting on the verse under consideration, Zamakhshari states that \u201cthe breathing of the spirit [of God] into a body signifies the endowing it with life\u201d: an explanation with which Razi concurs. As for the description of Mary as allati ahsanat farjaha; idiomatically denoting \u201cone who guarded her chastity\u201d (lit., \u201cher private parts\u201d), it is to be borne in mind that the term ihsan - lit., \u201c[one\u2019s] being fortified [against any danger or evil]\u201d - has the tropical meaning of \u201cabstinence from what is unlawful or reprehensible\u201d (Taj al-\u2019Arus), and especially from illicit sexual intercourse, and is applied to a man as well as a woman: thus, for instance, the terms muhsan and muhsanah are used elsewhere in the Qur\u2019an to describe, respectively, a man or a woman who is \u201cfortified [by marriage] against unchastity\u201d. Hence, the expression allati ahsanat farjaha, occurring in the above verse as well as in 66:12 with reference to Mary, is but meant to stress her outstanding chastity and complete abstinence, in thought as well as in deed, from anything unlawful or morally reprehensible: in other words, a rejection of the calumny (referred to in 4:156 and obliquely alluded to in 19:27-28) that the birth of Jesus was the result of an \u201cillicit union\u201d.",70],[21,91,3,"3.

The Traditionalist has latterly invested ummah with an emotional payload not found in the text, and tries to connect his religion with that of the people mentioned here. The fact is that any correspondence is either vestigial or coincidental, since he presses the book which chronicles that community (the Qur\u2019an) into the service of an entirely different set of writings. The Traditionalist translators Hilali & Khan have here: This, your Ummah [Sharia or religion (Islamic Monotheism)] is one religion, while the Traditionalist Saheeh International has: your religion, is one religion. But this is not honest dealing with the reader. For comparison, the non-sectarian N. J. Dawood translates: Your community is but one community. Meanwhile, non-sectarian A. J. Arberry has: Surely this community of yours is one community. The claim of the sectarian to represent the faith of all prophets can be sustained only by the type of deceit we have just seen. The sectarian has a religion or \u2014 more correctly \u2014 some religions. One can accept or reject one ore more of those religions. Insofar as any one of those religions bears correspondence with the Qur\u2019anic principles, it reflects that of previous men and women of God. To claim that the people listed in this s\u016brah followed a religion which bore a one-to-one relationship with any of those the Muslim world (based on non-Qur\u2019anic authorities) calls Isl\u0101m, is misdirection \u2014 a case of bait-and-switch \u2014 and a lie which methodical study of the Qur\u2019an itself abundantly exposes.",21],[21,92,2,"2.

However, on the basis of 21:105, I agree that zab\u016br indicates psalms in the sense of written songs. This word occurs at 4:163, 17:55 and 21:105. Muhammad Asad notes here: Zabar (lit., \u201cscripture\u201d or \u201cbook\u201d) is a generic term denoting any \u201cbook of wisdom\u201d: hence, any and all of the divine scriptures revealed by God to the prophets [Tabari]. What follows in the text is a direct quote from Psalms 37. It occurs at Psalms 37:29, but comparable verses are found at Psalms 37:9, 37:11, 37:22. On a related point, I have wondered why, given that Psalms 37 is quoted in the Qur\u2019an, the Traditionalist is so little interested in its contents. I believe I have the answer: it is because its contents are inconvenient to his broader project. Consider that Psalms 37:11 reads: \u05d5\u05e2\u05e0\u05d5\u05d9\u05dd \u05d9\u05d9\u05e8\u05e9\u05d5\u05be\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05d5\u05d4\u05ea\u05e2\u05e0\u05d2\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dc\u05be\u05e8\u05d1 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd\u05c3 (But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace), while Psalms 37:37 reads: \u05e9\u05de\u05e8\u05be\u05ea\u05dd \u05d5\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8 \u05db\u05d9\u05be\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea \u05dc\u05d0\u05d9\u05e9 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd (Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.) The word in both verses rendered peace (Hebrew: shalowm) is based on the same root from which musl\u012bm and isl\u0101m are formed in the Arabic of the Qur\u2019an. And while Psalms 37 lacks any support for the Traditionalist\u2019s religion, it is rich in the very themes which we identify in this work as central to the Qur\u2019anic narrative.",28],[21,105,2,"2. Arabic: dhikr \u2014 calling to mind, recalling, reminding; remembrance (of something past); history. This is claimed by the Traditionalist to refer to the Torah as a whole. There is no pan-textual support for this claim in the Qur\u2019an (see 21:48 and note thereto). Later expansions on the meaning of dhikr as part of cultural development notwithstanding (from bead-counting meditations to claimed titles for entire books), the Qur\u2019an\u2019s own use of the term is more localised, tending to indicate histories, either collective or individual, or the remembrance (the deeds, power, or promises) of God. My opinion is that the present context requires us to look to Psalms 37. There we find prior to Psalms 37:9 \u2014 i.e. prior to the first instance of the four comparable statements referred to in the Qur\u2019an at the present verse (see note to 21:105 above) \u2014 a condense remembrance of God (see Psalms 37:1-9).

Meanwhile, the non-sectarian A. J. Arberry is both concise and honest: Surely in this is a Message delivered unto a people who serve. The word rendered here (those) who serve (Arabic: \u02bf\u0101bid\u012bn) is found in the context of believers twice more in this s\u016brah (21:73, 21:84), and in neither can it be bent into the shape Hilali & Khan require of it here.",48],[21,108,1,"1.

Muhammad Asad adds: [...]comprises in this context two distinct concepts: that of fairness as regards the clarity and unambiguity of the above announcement, as well as of equality, implying that it is being made to all human beings alike[...].

There is considerable additional analysis in the present edition of this work of the dh\u0101likas at 22:30, 22:32, and 22:60 (see note to 22:30). The additional analysis there necessitated further analysis of all dh\u0101likas in the present s\u016brah on a pan-textual basis. That revealed a minor tension between dh\u0101lika bianna and both my previous translation of because and that found among other translators \u2014 typically: that is because. (I am aware, naturally, that Classical lexicons support the typical translation of that is because, or even of that is due to the fact that; what interests me is the formula\u2019s function on a Qur\u2019anic pan-textual basis.) The minor tension I mention arises since that is because should provide a link of plain causation between a preceding statement and what follows, yet that expectation is imperfectly met in some cases (consider as examples 2:176, 8:53, 9:6, 9:120, 22:6, 22:61, 22:62, 31:30, 47:3). I am not saying the standard value for dh\u0101lika bianna statements is wildly off; I am saying it is somewhat off and missing a minor component. Further, a number of dh\u0101lika bianna statements are followed by anna statements (i.e. statements which beat the same drum as the preceding dh\u0101lika bianna statement). This is the case here at 22:6. By using that is because the only way to retain the beat of subsequent anna statements is to repeat because (which is inelegant), or to ignore them altogether. The translation by Saheeh International of 22:6-7 illustrates a deeper problem: That is because All\u0101h is the Truth and because He gives life to the dead and because He is over all things competent / And [that they may know] that the Hour is coming \u2014 no doubt about it \u2014 and that All\u0101h will resurrect those in the graves. (Note: lower-case instances of that outside of parenthesis in the quoted verses correspond with the final two anna statements.) The problem is that the text runs off the rails of the initial trajectory set up by the opening That is because. But 22:6-7 is a single argument comprising five points, four of which relate to the opening dh\u0101lika bianna by means of anna statements. And 22:5 itself is a detailed and compelling argument. But 22:6 does not follow 22:5 in the frictionless way a that is because statement in English implies. For 22:6 to follow seamlessly from 22:5, dh\u0101lika bianna must do more than provide a link to what precedes and establish causation (both of which duties are provided by that is because), it must also supply an exposition of what precedes. Without the quality of exposition, the elements of linkage and causation fall flat rather than resound. Here, for example, the narrative function of 22:6 must be to build upon the list of statements which comprise 22:5, but the tones dh\u0101lika bianna needs to sound are rendered mute by the pedestrian that is because value. What is supposed to be a logical progression becomes two statements stapled together with that is because. Again, I am not saying the that is because value is entirely wrong. I am saying it is missing something; like listening to a passage of music on the bass and mid-range channels only, with the treble channel zeroed out. To illustrate by means of a simple case: He plants flowers. / That is because flowers are beautiful. The two statements are linked, and causation is established between them. However, there is no sense in which there is an exposition or development of the first statement by that which follows, no call to broader consideration of the primary statement in the light of the secondary statement (which I assert as the missing \u2018range\u2019). But we can retain all functions (linking, causation, and exposition) by means of: He plants flowers / For it is that flowers are beautiful! Here the because component is implicit to the structure; the two statement are clearly linked; and the second part is an exposition and development of the first. Moreover, any further points \u2014 that is anna statements \u2014 are easily added by means of and that[...]! It may be felt that the difference between that is because and for it is that is minimal; and I would agree. Yet there is a shift in nuance, one which preserves a register which is lost under the typical construction. We note that dh\u0101lika bianna occurs in s\u016brah 47 more times than in any other (a total of five), and that it occurs in close succession on two occasions (at 22:61 and 22:62, and at 59:13 and 59:14). Notepad XIV contains references for all dh\u0101lika bianna statements in the text, consideration of which is instructive. See also notes to 22:10 and 22:30.

Or Bending the neck. The noun \u02bfi\u1e6df (a side of the body) here is the only occurrence of the word\u2019s root in the text, and the collocation found here is said to have a number of meanings. We have nothing to cross-reference with, and are entirely dependent upon the lexicons which so often are themselves a function of non-Qur\u2019anic influences or later cultural developments.

Consideration of the three instances where this collocation occurs might suggest \u2018To be led away\u2019 as the reading here.

There is considerable additional analysis in the present edition of this work of the dh\u0101likas at 22:30, 22:32, and 22:60 (see note to 22:30). The additional analysis there necessitated further analysis of all dh\u0101likas in the present s\u016brah on a pan-textual basis. That both confirmed dh\u0101lika bim\u0101 in its typical definition as a close relative of dh\u0101lika bianna, and showed it to require the same treatment (see note to 22:6). The signature dh\u0101lika bim\u0101 occurs at six places in the text, all of which treat of two scenarios only: [...]opposed and exceeded all bounds (2:61, 3:112, 5:78) and [...]hands sent ahead (3:182, 8:51, 22:10).

The role of the elliptical dh\u0101likas (22:30, 22:32, 22:60) is discussed in detail in the note to 22:30. The present note treats of the pan-textual significance of dh\u0101lika huwa. This formula occurs 13 times in the text (9:72, 9:111, 10:64, 14:18, 22:11, 22:12, 35:32, 39:15, 40:9, 42:22, 44:57, 45:30, 57:12). The two instances found closest together are in the present s\u016brah (22:11 and 22:12) and draw thereby, I feel, the attention. To be clear: I understand the grammatical function of this construction; I am interested here in its function as a marker across the text. The present s\u016brah and s\u016brah 9 each contain two instances of dh\u0101lika huwa. In s\u016brah 22 both instances are \u2018negative\u2019 whereas in s\u016brah 9 both are \u2018positive\u2019 (see list of statement categories below). In every case, this formula treats of the ultimate condition of man (either loss and error, or achievement and favour), and together this set of verses (and immediate surrounding contexts) presents a synthesis of what one might call the bottom line: in what success does and does not consist. The motifs fall into the following statement categories: the tremendous achievement (9:72, 9:111, 10:64, 40:9, 44:57, 57:12); the extreme error (14:18, 22:12); the clear loss (22:11, 39:15); the great favour (35:32, 42:22); the clear achievement (45:30).

Some translators choose to interpret sam\u0101\u2019 (sky) as roof, and see an attempt at suicide by hanging; others, the imperative to stretch up a rope into the sky. Neither has merit in my view.

Translators include an object pronoun not found in the text here with varying degrees of transparency.

My analysis is as follows: the form I of this verb occurs only twice more in the text (9:120, 48:29), and in both instances treats of enraging those who reject or deny God; the participle is found once at 26:55 and there Fir\u02bfawn \u2014 the archetypal denier \u2014 is the object, and on that basis, I support the meaning I supply at the beginning of this note.

The fact that this verse is missing a component is understood by translators. N. J. Dawood achieves sense by taking liberties with the content; A. J. Arberry stays close to the Arabic and thus misses sense altogether; Traditionalist translators simply inject the English with sufficient interpolations to achieve sense, but on an ad hoc and ideologically driven basis. Thus, that there exists ellipsis within the verse is not in question. Ellipsis often produces a tentative voice, the function of which is to provide additional information without overstating any argument. This, I believe, is the case here, and this function is readily supplied by anticipating a later line in the present verse. Were this not supplied elliptically, the verse would state something which could not in all cases be so (that those described up to the point of ellipsis seek therein deviation by injustice), or that might be unfair (since all would be caused to taste of a painful punishment). The case is more nuanced (some may seek therein deviation by injustice, but some may not \u2014 or may not be aware of such an intention). And the tentative nature of the ellipsis allows for such cases since the thing is both being said and not said. However, as we shall soon see, in the case of those for whom the proposition holds true, no tentative mood applies: they are to taste of a painful punishment. I believe the ellipsis is required here to compensate for the absence of mitigating allowances (changes of heart, behaviour, etc.) frequently found in similar circumstances.",130],[22,25,5,"5.

See Notepad IV.",223],[22,27,1,"1. There is no question but that the addressee of 22:26 is Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. It is clear also that there is a shift to the time of Mu\u1e25ammad in what follows. The question is only at what point that shift occurs. The Traditionalist frequently assumes \u2014 and wishes the reader to assume \u2014 that the imperative mood has switched to Mu\u1e25ammad at the beginning of 22:27, but there is no strong indication of that, no use of such standard markers as \u2018Say thou\u2019 or \u2018O Prophet!\u2019 or \u2018O messenger!\u2019. Whereas Muhammad Asad is clear on where he stands \u2014 he renders here: Hence, [O Muhammad], proclaim thou unto all people the [duty of] pilgrimage \u2014 most Traditionalist translators are more subtle. While they build their assumptions quietly into their presentations, their treatment of 22:28 leaves us in no doubt that they have subtly made the same inference at 22:27 that Muhammad Asad had the honesty to trumpet; for example Hilali & Khan\u2019s rendering of 22:28 reads: That they may witness things that are of benefit to them (i.e. reward of Hajj in the Hereafter, and also some worldly gain from trade, etc.), and mention the Name of Allah on appointed days (i.e. 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th day of Dh\u016bl-Hijjah), over the beast of cattle that He has provided for them (for sacrifice) (at the time of their slaughtering by saying: Bismillah, WAllahu-Akbar, Allahumma Minka wa Ilaik). Then eat thereof and feed therewith the poor who have a very hard time. What the Traditionalist calls the \u1e25ajj is one of the five pillars of his religion. He is very clear on that. If even one pillar is dislodged, his entire operation is at an end. The portions of the text he can construe to create the impression that his \u2018pillar\u2019 of hajj is native to the Qur\u2019an are minimal. He must wring from what is available to him as much seeming correspondence as he can between his externally derived rituals and the text. This explains his impatience to transport the narrative to the time of Mu\u1e25ammad. However, on a more objective basis, while it is clear that the verses at 22:27-28 have an application both to Ibr\u0101h\u012bm and to Mu\u1e25ammad (and that the focus switches from the one to the other), the earliest point at which a shift can be objectively determined comes at 22:28 with the statement So eat thereof. The shift to the imperative plural indicates a clear adjustment from one narrative frame to another. The alternative is that Muhammad Asad is right in his reading (see above). But for that position to be tenable, one would need to point to overwhelming textual proof of a shift from the imperative singular of 22:26 (treating of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm) to an imperative singular at 22:27 treating of Mu\u1e25ammad. Muhammad Asad does not provide such proof, and in the absence of it, I see no textual justification to regard the opening of 22:27 as the \u2018join\u2019 between the two narratives. The entire scenario is of historical value to us now only in any case (see note to 9:28).",18],[22,27,2,"2. Arabic: \u1e25ajj \u2014 pilgrimage, debate. See note to 2:158. The verses which treat of \u1e25ajj are of historical interest only (see note to 9:28). There is no difference between such histories and those dealing, for example, with \u0100dam or N\u016b\u1e25.",49],[22,27,3,"3. Muhammad Asad comments here: Lit., \u201clean mount\u201d - an expression which has induced some of the commentators to assume that it denotes \u201ca camel that has become lean on account of a long and fatiguing journey\u201d. However, the verb dammarahu or admarahu relates in classical Arabic not only to camels but also to horses, and has the meaning of \u201che made it [i.e., the mount] lean and fit [for racing or war)\u201d; thus, the noun midmar signifies \u201ca training-ground where horses are prepared for racing or war\u201d, as well as \u201ca race-course\u201d (Jawhari, Asas, etc.; cf. also Lane V, 1803 f.). Hence, the adjectival noun damir - especially when contrasted, as above, with the expression rijalan (\u201con foot\u201d) - has the connotation of \u201cfleetness\u201d or, more properly, \u201cfitness for speed\u201d, and may by inference be applied to every kind of \u201cfast conveyance\u201d.",107],[22,27,4,"4. Arabic: \u02bfam\u012bq \u2014 deep (from \u02bfamuqa \u2014 to be or to become deep, profound) according to Wehr (p. 754). Lane (p. 2157) adds to deep values of remote or far-extending as the value at 22:27. Since this is the only instance of this root in the text, we have nothing to cross-reference with. In such cases it is impossible to establish to what extent Lane here reflects values of what he calls \u2018chaste\u2019 Arabic, or that the Arabic he records in this case is coloured by later exegetical or ideological considerations. Among the five translators I refer to most frequently in these notes, only A. J. Arberry employs deep; Hilali & Khan try to cover all options with deep and distant; the remaining three use distant or synonyms thereof.",139],[22,27,5,"5. Arabic: fajj \u2014 way, road between two mountains. This word occurs also at 21:31 (in the plural) where mountain passes clearly fits. If we accept deep as the value for \u02bfam\u012bq (see note above), then that supports a case for Petra as the locus of al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m (the city is approached by more than one dramatic ravine \u2014 including a cleft in the rock, no less, called al s\u012bq); no ravine is found in any approach to the city today called Mecca. I am not aware of a comparable claim under either the Arabia Felix thesis or \u02bfAs\u012br-\u1e24ej\u0101z thesis. However, if one accepts distant as the value for \u02bfam\u012bq (see note above), this argument loses force. But there are further considerations here. First among them is that the lack of \u2018deep mountain passes\u2019 in the vicinity of Mecca could have impacted the language and made \u02bfam\u012bq (whose root appears only here in the text) the object of linguistic modifications in order to make understanding of the text fit with the geographical reality of a later time. And second, we should consider that the Qur\u2019an \u2014 as the single text which binds the Arabic-speaking peoples together \u2014 naturally became the source of countless idioms (consider the influence of the King James Bible and of Shakespeare on the English language). Thus, min kulli fajjin \u02bfam\u012bq today can be used to mean from all sides, from all directions, from everywhere. In any case, the text treats here of directives given to Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, and today the Traditionalist\u2019s sole supposedly Qur\u2019anic evidence connecting the father of the great monotheistic religions with Mecca is a theatrical prop he calls maqam ibrahim \u2014 something which performs the offices of idol and religious \u2018artefact\u2019, and which an eight-year-old schoolboy would not accept as proof of any kind.",155],[22,28,1,"1. The Arabic here is: ma\u02bfl\u016bm\u0101t \u2014 given, known; fixed, determined, appointed. Nowhere does it say that these days are fixed by God. For the only other instance of ma\u02bfl\u016bm\u0101t see 2:197.",90],[22,28,2,"2. At this point the voice changes to the plural imperative, and the narrative focus can be said objectively to shift from the time of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm to that of Mu\u1e25ammad and those with him.",137],[22,29,1,"1. Arabic: tafath. Lane (p. 308) connects this root with physical hygiene, with tafath indicating the state of being dirty; the state of having matted and dusty hair. He includes increasing levels of specificity, but this is the general sense. This is the only instance of this root in the text. An instance of a rare or unique word in a context where support for one of his \u2018pillars\u2019 is the goal frequently triggers the Traditionalist, and Hilali & Khan do not disappoint, responding on this occasion with: Then let them complete the prescribed duties (Manasik of Hajj) for them. However, the Traditionalist translators at Saheeh International were not thus affected here, rendering: Then let them end their untidiness.",47],[22,29,2,"2. I.e. pay their vows. The notion of paying one\u2019s vows will be lost on the majority of moderns. It means to perform any outstanding obligations one has undertaken with God. (See Numbers 6 for the Nazarite vow; 1 Samuel 1:11 for Hannah\u2019s vow to God; also Psalms 50:14, 66:13-14.) The noun (sg. nadhr; pl. nudh\u016br) pertains to the form I verb nadhara \u2014 to dedicate, consecrate; to vow, to make a vow. The form I verb is found at 2:270, 3:35, 19:26, 21:45; the noun is found at 2:270, 22:29, 76:7.",71],[22,29,3,"3. Arabic: ta\u1e6dawwafa (form V). See note to 2:125.",88],[22,29,4,"4. Arabic: al bayt al \u02bfat\u012bq \u2014 the ancient house. This expression occurs at 22:29 and 22:33. The Traditionalist ascribes to this term a highly specialised meaning in support of his religion (namely, he chooses to claim it as a further appellation for the box-like structure to which he bows down in the city today known as Mecca). Some points of interest: firstly, the verb rendered circumambulate by the Traditionalist is demonstrably used in the Qur\u2019an to mean simply to move about or to circulate among (see note to \u1e6dawafa at 2:125); secondly, Petra and the surrounding region are acknowledged (by non-sectarians) as very ancient burial sites; thirdly, at Petra there are feasting halls attached to graves where tribes would meet and feast. I contend firstly, that whatever is meant by the ancient house, it does not \u2014 and could not \u2014 have anything to do with Mecca (see Notepad XVI, also my book The God Protocol); secondly, that the case for associating the ancient house with Petra is strong given that it was truly an ancient site at the time in question; and thirdly, that whatever was the accepted mode of behaviour at that time and place, it has now passed into history; were the details required by later generations they would have been preserved in the Qur\u2019an (consider the detailed coverage the Qur\u2019an gives to inheritance law, acceptable foods, menstrual courses, and admissible marriage partners; cf. 31:27). That site is now closed (see 9:28 and note thereto), and I see no reason why its interest to us today should be greater than that of other locations in which the historical dramas the Qur\u2019an includes are set. See also note to 22:30.",108],[22,30,1,"1. Sc. 22:67-70. The Traditionalist (and other) translators fumble for meaning with particular dh\u0101likas in this chapter (22:30, 22:32, 22:60). They interpolate and guess on an ad hoc basis, but neither convincingly nor with conviction. For example, at 22:30 A. J. Arberry has: All that; Saheeh International has: That [has been commanded], Muhammad Asad has: All this [is ordained by God]; and Hilali & Khan have: That (Manasik prescribed duties of Hajj is the obligation that mankind owes to Allah). At 22:32 A. J. Arberry has: All that; Saheeh International has: That [is so]. Muhammad Asad has: This is [to be borne in mind]. Meanwhile Hilali & Khan give us: Thus it is [what has been mentioned in the above said Verses (27, 28, 29, 30, 31) is an obligation that mankind owes to Allah]. Lastly, at 22:60 A. J. Arberry has: All that; Saheeh International has: That [is so]. Muhammad Asad has: Thus shall it be. And, finally, Hilali & Khan have: That is so. This is how these translators treat the exact same word at 22:30, 22:32, 22:60. Clearly, dh\u0101lika here is something of an extra spare wheel. Everyone understands that something has to be done with it; the question is what. At one end of the ideological spectrum, non-sectarian A. J. Arberry opts for unassuming consistency with All that, (though we have no way of knowing what All that, is). At the other, the highly doctrinaire Sunni Traditionalist translators Hilali & Khan are out to tell you exactly what All that is \u2014 and it is that they and their religion are critical to understanding the segment. What we can say with certainty in the light of the above is that what we shall be calling the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 dh\u0101likas (22:30, 22:32, 22:60) are elliptical; that is, they imply information which has been elided but which we are meant to deduce. The question is only what exactly the nature of that elided information is, and whether or not we can correctly identify it. Before we attend to that process, we need to be sure we understand the Traditionalist\u2019s motivations. Objectively, the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 dh\u0101likas (22:30, 22:32, 22:60) ill fit the surrounding text and create an ungainly stumble in the textual flow that translators do not know what to do with. But why could not the Traditionalist be satisfied with the type of opaque consistency as satisfied non-sectarian A. J. Arberry, creating the textual equivalent of O well, or Ho-hum? The answer is that the segment at 22:26-37 is one of a limited number of places available to the Traditionalist where he can \u2014 in fact, he must \u2014 leverage the text as far as possible to create the impression in the mind of the reader that his religion is native to the Qur\u2019anic text. Without that, his religion can be dismissed as cut from entirely different cloth. But of equal importance to him is the fact that the segment is susceptible to his application of highly specialised \u2018religious\u2019 values to rarely occurring words. In this case, he makes much of particular \u2018religious\u2019 rites (but see 22:34), for all details of which we are to trust him and his non-Qur\u2019anic literature. Since the terms to which he has affixed his specious definitions in the segment are either unique or extremely rare to the text as a whole, he has been able to claim his values knowing that nothing in the Qur\u2019anic text directly contradicts him. Thus, by inertia, his highly specialised definitions have stuck, both in the minds of translators and in the minds of readers. But the first and most obvious weakness for the Traditionalist here is that his value for the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 dh\u0101likas is different in each case. That ill fits with the fact that the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 dh\u0101likas are themselves identical in each case. But that neither proves wrong his claims nor improves upon his interpolations. To do that we must consider the textual evidence methodically, critically, and pan-textually. So let us begin with what we know. It is a fact that three instances of dh\u0101lika in the present s\u016brah (22:30, 22:32, 22:60) ill fit the surrounding text. Under the methodology practiced here, this characteristic invites deeper investigation. And if the reader wishes to review examples where conspicuous features of the text have both stimulated investigation and yielded rich exegetical insight, he should consider the cases of kadh\u0101lika (see note to 18:91), kall\u0101 (see note to 74:16), and am (see note to 21:21). We also know that dh\u0101lika is common to the broader text (it occurs a total of 280 times in this precise form), and is found 11 times in the present s\u016brah (22:6, 22:10, 22:11, 22:12, 22:30, 22:32, 22:60, 22:61, 22:62, 22:70, 22:70). If we consider the 11 dh\u0101likas of this s\u016brah we note first that the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 dh\u0101likas occur in an unbroken sequence (22:30, 22:32, 22:60), insomuch as no other instance of dh\u0101lika divides them. Next we see that this discrete subset of three \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 dh\u0101likas falls precisely at the midpoint of the sequence, with four instances of dh\u0101lika occurring both prior to it and following it. Next we see that each cluster of four dh\u0101likas either side of the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 set of three, itself comprises two double clusters of two dh\u0101likas (22:6 and 22:10; 22:11 and 22:12; 22:61 and 22:62; 22:70 and 22:70). The signatures for each instance in the four minor sets are as follows: 22:6 (dh\u0101lika + bianna) and 22:10 (dh\u0101lika + bim\u0101); 22:11 (dh\u0101lika + huwa) and 22:12 (dh\u0101lika + huwa); 22:61 (dh\u0101lika + bianna) and 22:62 (dh\u0101lika + bianna); 22:70 (inna dh\u0101lika + f\u012b) and 22:70 (inna dh\u0101lika + \u02bfal\u0101). Now that we have covered the available textual data on dh\u0101lika at s\u016brah 22 we can summarise what we know: we know the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 dh\u0101likas to be elliptical statements; we know that they imply something; we know that the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 dh\u0101likas form an unbroken chain of three flanked by four other dh\u0101lika statements on either side. We will now consider what this can mean. Firstly, the central position of the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 dh\u0101likas provides symmetry to the phenomenon of dh\u0101likas in the s\u016brah. This fact indicates a relationship between the central three dh\u0101likas and those in each of the two flanks. Secondly, the unbroken consistency which we observe in the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 dh\u0101likas implies that their value must be uniform (i.e. a single value which applies to all of the three cases). On the basis of the two observations above \u2014 and given the known elliptical nature of the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 dh\u0101likas \u2014 we conclude that the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 dh\u0101likas must have a single value; that value must derive from one of the remaining dh\u0101likas in the s\u016brah; and that value must be unique. Since there are three instances of dh\u0101lika + bianna in the flanks we can exclude these (dh\u0101lika + bianna has its own pan-textual significance and occurs 7 times across the broader text, and is discussed in the note to 22:6). While the dh\u0101lika + bim\u0101 signature occurs only once in the s\u016brah, it occurs 6 times across the broader text (it also has its own pan-textual significance, and is discussed in the note to 22:10). The dh\u0101lika + huwa signature occurs twice in the s\u016brah, so we can exclude it. Additionally, it occurs a total of 12 times across the broader text (it also has its own pan-textual significance, and is discussed in the note to 22:11). The second of the two inna dh\u0101lika statements at 22:70 (inna dh\u0101lika + \u02bfal\u0101) occurs four times across the broader text (it also has its own pan-textual significance, and is discussed in the note to 22:70). This leaves the inna dh\u0101lika + f\u012b signature at 22:70. Not only is it unique within this s\u016brah, it is found nowhere outside of it. Thus, it is a single, unique value, and as such must be the point to which the three \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 dh\u0101likas point. Before we continue, let us consider more generally: if an important message notes \u2018that\u2019 as a significant item three times but without clear elucidation, where would one look for the value of \u2018that\u2019 other than where the text itself tells you: verily, that is[...]? This is precisely the context the unique inna dh\u0101lika + f\u012b signature at 22:70 supplies. To continue: we know that the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 dh\u0101likas anticipate something unsaid explicitly (which is the nature of elliptical statements). And we know also from our broader analysis of the Qur\u2019an that dh\u0101lika always refers to something prior to the dh\u0101lika marker (see note to 2:2). Since we know that the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 dh\u0101likas\u2019 elliptical values anticipate the inna dh\u0101lika + f\u012b signature at 22:70, that statement itself must derive its value from what precedes it. The remaining logistical question is: how far back does the inna dh\u0101lika + f\u012b signature at 22:70 refer? It must logically reach back as far as the first hard subject break, and that comes at 22:67. Now that we have established both the mechanics and the value for the three \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 dh\u0101likas, we can now consider the significance of that value. The verse at 22:67 begins: For every community We appointed a rite for them to perform[...] There is only one possible reference for this, and that is at 22:34 where that \u2018rite\u2019 is spelled out: that they remember the name of God over what He has provided them of livestock cattle. The reader is expected to understand this association as he applies the value 22:67-70 at each instance of the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 dh\u0101likas (22:30, 22:32, 22:60). Analysed on a thorough pan-textual basis, it is seen that the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 dh\u0101likas provide intrinsic Qur\u2019anic proof against precisely the type of abuses the Traditionalist attempts upon the Qur\u2019an. Once we have grasped both the mechanism and the value of the \u2018awkward and solitary\u2019 dh\u0101likas, it matters little what extraneously derived or imagined rites the Traditionalist would bind upon us; we have the Qur\u2019an\u2019s own word for it: there is only one rite, and it consists in remembering God\u2019s name over livestock as meat. Whether we read 22:26-37 as a history of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, as a history of Mu\u1e25ammad, or as a convergence of the two matters not; the elliptical dh\u0101likas at 22:30, 22:32 and 22:60 point the reader three times to the indisputable facts of 22:67-70, and those values put paid to all and any later insinuations from no matter what quarter. The facts are clear: firstly, that God appointed one rite for every community (contrary to what the Traditionalist would bind upon his followers) and, secondly, that Mu\u1e25ammad himself knew this and taught accordingly (contrary again to what the Traditionalist would bind upon his followers). Moreover, anyone troubling himself to read the two verses following the elliptical values (i.e. 22:71-72) will find a chilling condemnation (and readily recognisable characterisation) of those who historically have been most insistent in forcing their extraneously derived religion upon the believer.

Muhammad Asad renders the Arabic awth\u0101n somewhat freely as the loathsome evil of idolatrous beliefs and practices but goes on to note in his comment: The term awthan (lit., \u201cidols\u201d) denotes not merely actual, concrete images of false deities but also, in its widest sense, everything that is associated with false beliefs and practices or with a tendency to \u201cworship\u201d false values: hence the subsequent injunction to shun \u201cevery word that is untrue\u201d.",198],[22,30,4,"4.

The Traditionalist is quick here to insert specious, externally derived values for the usual reasons (see note to 2:125), but the plain meaning of \u2018the tokens of God\u2019 is those things which indicate the existence of God. The following context certainly treats of animals (named specifically at 22:34), and while the word benefits (Arabic: man\u0101fi\u02bf) found at 22:33 is not exclusively associated with animals in the broader text, it is clearly associated with them at 16:5, 23:21-22, 36:71-73, 40:79-80. Thus, it is acceptable to understand animals as the reference here at 22:32, though not mentioned specifically. We note that nowhere in this dataset can the Traditionalist point to values for sha\u02bf\u0101\u2019ir allah that he needs in the present context. Further, the Traditionalist\u2019s assertion here of particular rites for sha\u02bf\u0101\u2019ir allah is shown to be weak when considered on the basis of Qur\u2019anic evidence (for which see notes to 22:33). However, even if this collocation had the value the Traditionalist claims (and thus relates to rites at al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m), they were for a limited time since access to that site is now closed to the believers (see 9:28 and Notepad XVI). See note to 2:158.",48],[22,32,3,"3. See note to al muttaq\u016bn at 2:2.",82],[22,33,1,"1. Arabic: man\u0101fi\u02bf. See note to 22:32.",28],[22,33,2,"2. One should remember that the Traditionalist is committed in this segment to gaining maximum purchase upon the Qur\u2019an for his externally derived religion (see also note to 2:125 and 22:30). And here he needs to achieve highly specialised meanings for sha\u02bf\u0101\u2019ir allah (see notes 2:158 and 22:32) as part of that objective. It is understandable, therefore, in attempting to understand whether his claims are valid, that we should take an interest at this juncture in the phrase \u2018to a stated term\u2019 (Arabic: il\u0101 ajalin musamman) since it applies to the animals for which the Traditionalist claims here an exceptional value. Exceptional claims require exceptional proof. And if he is right in his exceptional claim here of a value of sacrificial animals \u2014 and that the sense is not simply animals in general (see note to 22:32) \u2014 then we should expect this accompanying formula to bear that interpretation out. We should begin with what the Traditionalist means by \u2018to a stated term\u2019 here. He means: until a \u2018religiously\u2019 significant, appointed moment in his externally constructed process at which animals brought to his annual pilgrimage are slaughtered. That is his baseline requirement, and anything which confirms this type of sense across the broader text will provide him with genuine support. Analysis of the phrase \u2018to a stated term\u2019 reveals the following facts: 1. it occurs a total of 11 times in the text; 2. it is found in the present s\u016brah twice, more than in any other; 3. it is found nowhere outside of this verse in a context of claimed specialised religious definitions; 4. leaving aside the present context at 22:33, in all cases except one it treats of God\u2019s judgment or works: God\u2019s provision; the span God allows (or extends) for men\u2019s life or time of birth; or God\u2019s chosen time of destruction. And in the single instance which treats of men, the context is mundane: the voluntary conclusion of contracts between men. The full set is found at: 2:282, 11:3, 14:10, 16:61, 22:5, 22:33, 31:29, 35:45, 39:42, 42:14, 71:4. Thus, nowhere in the remaining cases of this set can one point to anything which would support the Traditionalist\u2019s case, nothing which treats of any context whatever in which \u2018religious\u2019 ritual is the dominant theme. On the basis of this evidence, the Traditionalist\u2019s specialised claim here is highly specific, anomalous, and lacks any pan-textual support.",47],[22,33,3,"3. Arabic: ma\u1e25ill. See note to 2:196.",81],[22,33,4,"4. Arabic: al bayt al \u02bfat\u012bq \u2014 the ancient house. See 22:29 and note thereto.",104],[22,34,1,"1. The Traditionalist\u2019s stock-in-trade is (what one might call sectarian) rite and dogma. As he himself acknowledges, the Qur\u2019an is conspicuously lacking in both. Here, however, we are given a single rite with enough detail to allow us to implement it, and in a context which speaks of every community. On this basis we may reasonably assume that we are to keep this rite. This point is confirmed at 22:67. See also note to 22:30. Here, for the usual reasons, the Traditionalist frequently attempts to interpolate his required conclusions into the text; Saheeh International, for example, has: And for all religion We have appointed a rite [of sacrifice] that they may mention the name of All\u0101h over what He has provided for them of [sacrificial] animals. This is a deceit on at least three counts. Firstly, ummah is translated by him (usually) as community and not religion; secondly, he has inserted \u2018sacrificial\u2019 next to \u2018rite\u2019 where it does not exist; thirdly, he has inserted \u2018sacrificial\u2019 next to \u2018animals\u2019 where it does not exist. The word he translates animals here (Arabic: al an\u02bf\u0101m) occurs 33 times in the text (3:14, 4:119, 5:1, 5:95, 6:136, 6:138, 6:138, 6:138, 6:139, 6:142, 7:179, 10:24, 16:5, 16:66, 16:80, 20:54, 22:28, 22:30, 22:34, 23:21, 25:44, 25:49, 26:133, 32:27, 35:28, 36:71, 39:6, 40:79, 42:11, 43:12, 47:12, 79:33, 80:32). In no other case does he claim the reference to be to \u2018sacrificial\u2019 animals.",131],[22,35,1,"1. Arabic: al \u1e63\u0101bir\u016bn. See note to 2:155.",65],[22,35,2,"2. Arabic: al \u1e63al\u0101t; i.e. such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3 and Article SZC. While what the Traditionalist calls al \u1e63al\u0101t is the dominant human activity at his box in Mecca, there is no implication here that al \u1e63al\u0101t pertains to what he calls the \u1e25ajj \u2014 not even the Traditionalist claims that. There is no mention here of al \u1e63al\u0101t in or during \u1e25ajj or at al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m. This contrasts with the Qur\u2019an\u2019s account of Zakariyy\u0101 at 3:39 where the context is clearly religious and the performance of duty (\u1e63al\u0101t) is specified in terms of location. Rather, here at 22:35 there is merely repetition of a common formula, and no reference to location.",115],[22,35,3,"3. This motif occurs in six places (2:2, 8:3, 22:35, 28:54, 32:16, 42:38). In the first three instances (2:2, 8:3, 22:35) it is prefaced directly by mention of al \u1e63al\u0101t.",162],[22,36,1,"1. Arabic: sha\u02bf\u0101\u2019ir allah \u2014 the tokens of God. The Traditionalist is quick here to assert highly specialised values which emphasise sacrifice, but see notes to 2:158 and 22:32.",66],[22,36,2,"2. Or become requisite. Arabic: wajaba. This root occurs only once in the text. Wehr (p. 1229) gives meanings of to be necessary, be requisite, and developments thereof. Lane (p. 2921) covers the same ground, but also includes the value which the Traditionalist emphasises such as falling to the ground and collapsing. Given the Traditionalist\u2019s impositions over time of values with sectarian impetus upon words \u2014 especially upon words found rarely \u2014 in the Qur\u2019an, this may be a case of dogma driving language, but God knows best. I have rendered in the translation after the meaning the Traditionalist prefers and confine my dissent to the notes. The broader question is entirely moot since al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m was closed to believers within the time of the revelation (see note to 9:28, and my book The God Protocol).",186],[22,36,3,"3. Or the contented. Arabic: q\u0101ni\u02bf. This word occurs only once. Its root conveys senses of satisfied or contented and Muhammad Asad renders to some extent in that vein. However, the Traditionalist consensus is that the reference is to beggars or to poor people who do not ask. I think this may be a later development and a case of usage driving language. My view is that it means offering food to anyone who wants it including those in no particular need. However, I have rendered after the received meaning, and confine my dissent to the notes. The broader question is entirely moot since al masjid al \u1e25ar\u0101m was closed to believers within the time of the revelation (see note to 9:28, and my book The God Protocol).",226],[22,36,4,"4. Arabic: mu\u02bftarr. This word occurs only once. Its meanings listed by Wehr (p. 702) include miserable, wretched. This is generally translated as beggar (and synonyms). This is certainly what it has come to mean and I have rendered accordingly.",243],[22,37,1,"1. See note to al muttaq\u016bn at 2:2.",65],[22,37,2,"2. The broader passage which deals with slaughtering livestock and feeding the poor and which comprises what the Traditionalist asserts as a religious duty binding upon all begins at 22:28. The phrase So eat thereof at that verse marks the shift from a history which treats of the time of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm to a history which treats of the time of Mu\u1e25ammad (see notes to 22:26 and 22:36). Between that point and this, despite the Traditionalist\u2019s best efforts to achieve some purchase upon the text for one of the pillars of his religion (the \u1e25ajj), the pickings are so meagre that apart from his usual tactics of claiming highly specialised values for rarely occurring words and inserting words which do not exist in the text, he is able to point to nothing in the words on the page here to support his conclusions. The entire sequence is, however, fully consonant with a historical event at the time of the Messenger the chief lessons of which are common to the Qur\u2019an. Moreover, the categories of men identified for \u2018glad tidings\u2019 in the segment are not those who \u2018perform \u1e25ajj\u2019 or anything of that sort. Rather, it is \u2018the humble\u2019 (22:34), and \u2018the doers of good\u2019 (22:37). There is a total of eight \u2018bear thou glad tidings to\u2019 statements followed by plural nouns (2:25, 2:155, 2:223, 9:113, 10:2, 10:87, 22:34, 22:37). The objects of \u2018the humble\u2019 (22:34), and \u2018the doers of good\u2019 (22:37) are both unique within that set. Clearly, the virtues of humility before God and doing good works are essential to the passage at 22:28-37, yet it is not possible to claim those virtues as either the exclusive provenance or defining features of the Traditionalist\u2019s annual rituals at Mecca, and nor does he claim them to be so. The Traditionalist\u2019s broader claims here are addressed in notes to 9:28 and 22:30.",221],[22,38,1,"1. Arabic: alladh\u012bna \u0101man\u016b.

The broader context there is of a small number of believers (at 2:249 \u1e6c\u0101l\u016bt expels the half-hearted) overcoming a much larger number.

This form II verb is the only instance of the h-d-m root, a fact which suggests that particular care should be taken with it. However, having looked at all available lexicons, there seems to have been no attempt to co-opt it. The verb means to destroy, to raze, to pull down or to demolish. There are no grounds as far as I know to believe it treats of anything other than physical structures.",198],[22,40,5,"5. Arabic: biya\u02bf. This word is said by the Traditionalist to mean churches. This is the only instance of this word, which fact renders it vulnerable for the usual reasons. Clearly, biya\u02bf has come to mean churches (as in church buildings) over time, but there are excellent grounds for doubting this as the original meaning. The verb root from which biya\u02bf is derived is b-y-\u02bf. This root has two related senses: allegiance and trade; they are related since allegiance is pledged in the same way as trade is conducted: by means of contract. The many meanings found in any comprehensive Arabic lexicon formed on this root relate to just such a source (i.e. contract and trade) \u2014 with the exception of biya\u02bf. All other instances of this root in the Qur\u2019an conform absolutely to this principle (9:111, 48:10, 48:10, 48:18, 60:12, 60:12, 60:12; 2:282; 2:254, 2:275, 2:275, 9:111, 14:31, 24:37, 62:9). The word bay\u02bf (visually identical to biya\u02bf in its non-diacritic form) means sale or trade, for example (cf. especially 24:36-38); Lane (p. 285) notes bay\u02bf as the hire or hiring (of land), a thing sold or bought. See further notes to this verse.",210],[22,40,6,"6. Arabic: \u1e63alaw\u0101t \u2014 plural of \u1e63al\u0101t; i.e. such duties as are incumbent. See note to 2:3 and Article SZC. Generically, \u1e63al\u0101t denotes duty. In its primary sense it is the duty both to serve and seek help from God alone as per the covenant at 1:1-7 of which the statement at 1:5 forms our part \u2014 commitment to which also satisfies the pre-existing obligation every man has to acknowledge God\u2019s authority (see 7:172). Here, however, the Traditionalist again abandons his default value for \u1e63al\u0101t as a five-time daily ritual (of a particularly \u2018Muslim\u2019 kind), this time \u2014 bizarrely \u2014 in favour of Jewish synagogues. I remain confirmed in my stated value for \u1e63al\u0101t throughout. See extended note to this verse below.",223],[22,40,7,"7. Arabic: masjid, mas\u0101jid. See Notepad VII.i.",246],[22,40,8,"8. Sc. would be lost. One should understand the Traditionalist\u2019s problems at this verse, because once we understand those, it becomes clear why he has rendered the verse so bizarrely (with \u1e63alaw\u0101t as Jewish synagogues and the established root for trade and contract as churches). He wishes to achieve an equivalence for his religion with the religions called Christianity and Judaism. We know that mas\u0101jid cannot possibly mean what the Traditionalist claims for it (i.e. specifically \u2014 and exclusively \u2014 \u2018Islamic\u2019 places of worship) but, rather, means places of worship in a general, non-sectarian sense (cf. 7:29, 17:7 and Notepad VII.i); but the Traditionalist has been able to fudge that point in the eyes of the laity. Having done that, the way is clear to attempt to get from monasteries (or pious communities) to his fudged value for mas\u0101jid as mosques in a way which implies equal status for his religion. He attempts to do that by ascribing the values of the buildings characteristic for the main monotheistic religions to the stages in between \u2014 despite the fact that the result is both contrary to the norms of Arabic and to all comparable values in the Qur\u2019an. But the Traditionalist has a second and equally compelling reason to bend this verse into his service: if we allow the normative values for each of the constituent parts, it reads as an endorsement of discrete religious communities, something the Traditionalist has an ideological predisposition against. The religion which is today called Islam is interested in a very different model: that of the Caliphate \u2014 a uniform monolith under a single ruler. This concept is nowhere found in the Qur\u2019an. However, while the object of creating and maintaining a community dedicated to God alone is absolutely central to the message of the Qur\u2019an, men have shown themselves typically more interested in this-worldly conquest than in what the Qur\u2019an has to say. Thus, I am suggesting that a pious community of the type mentioned here at 22:40 is the unit of Qur\u2019anic advancement, and it is to the end of creating and maintaining such units that imperatives to the believers as a group tend to be directed. I am suggesting also that this reading was inconvenient to interests invested in territorial conquest and conformist, non-thinking \u2018religion\u2019. These, then, are the underlying currents which I believe have worn biya\u02bf into churches (in this one instance only) and \u1e63alaw\u0101t into the surreal value of Jewish synagogues (in this one instance only). The Traditionalist can then point to mas\u0101jid and claim his religious buildings to be comparable with those of Christianity and Judaism (while both defusing any implied imperative to form overtly pious communities, and keeping military action infused with religious purpose). However, if we allow mas\u0101jid its Qur\u2019anic sense of places of worship (see Notepad VII.i), the Traditionalist\u2019s values for \u1e63aw\u0101mi\u02bf, biya\u02bf, and \u1e63alaw\u0101t become superfluous since they are all places of worship. Turning to \u1e63aw\u0101mi\u02bf, we find it is typically rendered monasteries. Lexicons list Christian hermitages and monks\u2019 cells. The underlying root sense appears to be something tapered towards the top, and in Lane (p. 1738), is associated with the eagle (which seeks the highest point to which it can ascend). I think the association with isolated Christian monks\u2019 cells is a later development, and became attached partly due to the word\u2019s vulnerability to later impositions (this is the sole instance of this root in the text), and partly due to the Traditionalist\u2019s ideological requirements of this passage outlined in this note. The values attached to \u1e63aw\u0101mi\u02bf today emphasise seclusion and piety at the expense of community, but that emphasis does not comport with what precedes at 22:39-40. Rather, the Qur\u2019anic text suggests organic communities capable of defending themselves, not isolated believers easily expelled. This is the basis on which I justify my value of pious communities. Believing communities have been associated with religions of all stripes since time immemorial. Monasteries or other organised religious communities typically formed the economic and intellectual centres of the broader communities among which they were founded or \u2014 more commonly \u2014 which grew up around them. It is precisely the economic life focused on the \u2018pious communities\u2019 which biya\u02bf naturally references (i.e. trade) since such communities both generated and required material goods; \u1e63alaw\u0101t merely means here what it means throughout (i.e. duties) \u2014 duty being what has characterised life in religious communities across millennia no matter what the denomination or confession (each member typically has a strict set of duties to perform consonant with the order of which he is a member); lastly, the \u2018places of worship wherein the name of God is remembered much\u2019 are merely a central and necessary feature of any such religious community. The reason I believe there to be an elliptical statement at the end of this clause is that the conclusion is inherently tentative. Trade and duties and places of worship wherein the name of God is remembered much may survive the destruction of a pious community, but it is, perhaps, unlikely. It is not a rule set in stone, but a possibility which merits warning. Had God stated this conclusion explicitly, that would connote an immutable principle. Since we are left to infer the consequences, the status of the warning is different.",296],[22,41,1,"1. I.e. the \u2018him\u2019 who helps God, and is helped by God, at 22:40.",10],[22,41,2,"2.

This word means desire or vain desire or wish. It occurs at 2:78, 2:111, 4:123, 4:123, 22:52, 57:14. The Traditionalist translators typically render it thus in all cases \u2014 except here. In this specific case, Saheeh International gives us: And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet except that when he spoke [or recited], while Hilali & Khan render as: Never did We send a Messenger or a Prophet before you, but; when he did recite the revelation or narrated or spoke. This is very odd, and may be instantly contrasted with the Arabist and non-sectarian A. J. Arberry\u2019s rendering: We sent not ever any Messenger or Prophet before thee, but that Satan cast into his fancy. Fellow non-sectarian N. J.

However, the word here (mansak) is a singular noun, and the sentence simply restates the only instance of a universal rite found in the Qur\u2019an (see 22:34). The argument here is precisely the opposite of what the Traditionalist wishes for it: a statement against the practice of imposing rites and claiming them to be from God.

It contains al zak\u0101t but cannot in truth be suborned to a single value of paying a percentage tax on wealth, which is his required outcome. His broader presentation relies on his extraneously derived values for this term, and that the imperative formula in which al zak\u0101t is found (\u0101t\u016b al zak\u0101t) typically comes without obvious context, and this makes comparative analysis difficult. Here the formula is different, and this provides us data by which to compare al zak\u0101t as a term. The verb is fa\u02bfla (to do, to act) and comes in combination with the preposition li which, though it has a range of functions, can be understood here to play the same role as the li in the following verse, where it provides stylistic support for the object only. Muhammad Asad translates somewhat freely here: and who are intent on inner purity but notes: Lit., \u201cworking for\u201d or \u201cactive in behalf of [inner] purity\u201d, which is the meaning of zakah in this context (Zamakhshari; the same interpretation has been advanced by Abu Muslim). I agree with Asad\u2019s value for al zak\u0101t here. My point would be that this broader, generic value is the general sense of al zak\u0101t in all cases, and verses 23:5-9 provide genuine context which both confirms that value and adds detail to it (see Article SZC). Maintenance of the sexual impetus within the bounds stated at 23:5-6 (more broadly: within heterosexual relations between men and women where the man has concluded a marriage contract with the woman) is a material (as well as spiritual) contribution made by the individual to the society. The man is materially responsible for the woman, and the woman is also in a material commitment to exclude herself from the marketplace of females open to offers of marriage. While there is a number of instances where the Traditionalist\u2019s preferred value for al zak\u0101t jars with the context in which al zak\u0101t is found, there is none in which purity does so. Traditionalist translators at Saheeh International appear to recognise this verse as a pothole in their road, and stumble over it the best they can with: And they who are observant of zak\u0101h, while remaining silent on what that might mean. Meanwhile, Hilali & Khan ride over the Arabic on caterpillar tracks to achieve: And those who pay the Zakat. On a related point, there is a correlation between 23:2-9 and 70:23-34 which a reader familiar with the Qur\u2019an will recognise. Minor differences aside, there are three distinguishing features: 23:3-4 (not found in 70:23-34), and 70:24-28 and 70:33 (not found in 23:2-9). A superficial comparison might lead to the view that verses 70:24-25 relate to \u2014 or expand upon \u2014 23:4, and then claim support for the Traditionalist\u2019s value for al zak\u0101t on that basis. The facts are these: the \u2018bookends\u2019 are clear in each case (23:2 and 23:9, and 70:23 and 70:34); whereas there are comparable \u2018variables\u2019 on both sides (23:3-4 and 70:24-28), there is a single \u2018addition\u2019 at 70:33 (i.e. with no correlation between 23:2-9); lastly, verses 70:23-34 comprise the greater text. This means that the only question is at what point one \u2018adds\u2019 23:3-4 to 70:23-34 to achieve a \u2018full\u2019 text: before 70:24-28 or after it. If one \u2018adds\u2019 23:3-4 after 70:24-28, the argument that 70:24-25 relate to \u2014 or expand upon \u2014 23:4 is null. However, 70:24-25 cannot logically be said to expand upon 23:4 since 70:24-28 contain two main points (both charity and the Day of Judgment), and that neither makes sense nor comports with the Traditionalist\u2019s value for al zak\u0101t in any way. Thus, the only way to \u2018reconstitute\u2019 the passage is by \u2018inserting\u2019 23:3-4 after 70:24-28.",35],[23,5,1,"1. Arabic: (sg.) farj, (pl.) fur\u016bj.

Points arising include the fact that the Qur\u2019an does not say that M\u016bs\u0101 talked with God at sayn\u0101\u2019 and there is no direct Qur\u2019anic identification of sayn\u0101\u2019 with that location where those events took place; these are assumptions drawn from the Hebrew scriptures (and we know that the Qur\u2019an frequently corrects or contradicts the Hebrew scriptures). The mountain claimed for M\u016bs\u0101\u2019s encounter with God under the Egypt-Palestine thesis and found in the land today called Sinai was identified by Queen Helena, sister of the Emperor Constantine, based \u2014 at best \u2014 on incomplete information; there is little or no evidence to support that location, and much to refute it. The Petra thesis \u2014 or, at least, the Petra pilgrimage thesis \u2014 might incline towards the location at Jabal al Lawz, known locally as Jabal M\u016bs\u0101, in the northern part of modern Saudi Arabia, around 120 miles from Petra; however, that location is not a \u1e6d\u016br (mount) in the strict sense since Jabal al Lawz is barren (at least, that is the case now) and, again, the Qur\u2019an does not identify sayn\u0101\u2019 with that location where M\u016bs\u0101 spoke with God, rather, one is accustomed to assume it under the influence of the dominant Egypt-Palestine thesis. The Arabia Felix thesis advances a location for sayn\u0101\u2019 which provides a more impressive correlation between the Qur\u2019anic statements and geological and agricultural realities.

It is that these two verses provide clear allusions to two other parts of the Qur\u2019an \u2014 the first allusion being found in the opening line of 23:76, and the second in the closing line of 23:77. Here at 23:76, the allusion is to the story of M\u016bs\u0101\u2019s mission to Fir\u02bfawn at 43:46-56. The opening line of 23:76 contains \u2018We seized them with the punishment\u2019 (Arabic: akhadhn\u0101hum bi al \u02bfadh\u0101b). This exact statement occurs only once more in the Qur\u2019an, at 43:48. There it is followed by the statement which I have supplied here as an ellipsis (it will be remembered that ellipsis is commonly used to supply a tentative or non-binding conclusion or thought \u2014 here, the idea that \u2018they might return\u2019 is obsolete in the case to which it alludes, since it is too late for such an eventuality for the followers of Fir\u02bfawn, although it has an application for those yet living).

In the note to 23:76, that verse is demonstrated to contain an implicit allusion to 43:46-56 by virtue of an exact correlation in phrasing between the opening segment of 23:76 and 43:46-56. I regard 23:77 likewise as an allusion \u2014 here on the basis of its closing phrase. This verse ends with \u2018they are therein in despair\u2019 (Arabic: hum fihi mublis\u016bn) which connects it ineluctably with 43:74-77, the segment which, at 43:75, contains the only other instance of this precise statement.

My first instinct always where there is an obvious disruption to the narrative flow is to consider what I call implicit punctuation (e.g. parenthesis required by the context). There is a clear case of such disruption here, resolved by means of parenthesis (allowing this point to follow on from 24:22). The subtle implication is that a way remains open to those who have spread calumny against believing women to make good (by means of generosity to those listed at 24:22). That the Traditionalist has been stumped here is clear from the alternative interpretation of 24:26 which developed. According to that interpretation al khab\u012bth\u016bn (bad men) means bad words, and al \u1e6dayyib\u0101t (good women) means good words.

The present clause is an ideological battleground in the war to prove a requirement for women to wear what is today called \u1e25ij\u0101b in the Qur\u2019an. The word here is khumur (sg. khim\u0101r), and the term has acquired so much baggage that the best I can say of it is that it means coverings (certainly, that is the sense of related verb which means to cover, hide, conceal). People from culturally \u2018Islamic\u2019 countries often get emotional because in those cultures khim\u0101r does in fact denote a head-covering. To say that this is what the Qur\u2019an means by the term is another matter. Again, with the word juy\u016bb (here: bosoms), the understanding will depend to a large extent on the required outcome. For example, dyed-in-the-wool Traditionalists Hilali & Khan have here: and to draw their veils all over Juyubihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms, etc.). This is a cultural and ideological position, and should be understood as such. Since this is a disproportionately important issue for many people, so I will summarise my own thoughts on it in the following manner: Is it true that the Qur\u2019an requires a head-covering for all believing women? No, it is not. Does the Qur\u2019an require believing women to dress modestly? Yes, it does. Do societies exist in which a head-covering is a requirement of modesty? Yes, there do. Does traditional \u2018Islamic\u2019 dress (i.e. long dress and headscarf) encompass the Qur\u2019anic requirement for believing women? Yes, it does. Is the traditional \u2018Islamic\u2019 dress the same thing as the Qur\u2019anic requirement? No, it is not. Now, while I know the claim that traditional \u2018Islamic\u2019 dress is a Qur\u2019anic imperative to be false, I must add the following point: women are told to dress so that they will be recognised as believers and not harassed (33:59). A headscarf and the other modesty requirements found in traditional \u2018Islamic\u2019 dress together meet this criterion for historical reasons (i.e. such women are, by dint of custom, known to be women of faith). However, traditional Jewish and Christian (Orthodox) women\u2019s dress meets these requirements also. Distinct from these observations, it is my opinion that women who choose to dress modestly are providing a great service to themselves, their families, and their societies; I also hold it to be a crime before God to ascribe to the Qur\u2019an imperatives which the Qur\u2019an does not contain. The problem in today\u2019s media-driven society, of course, is that the association with faith which the headscarf once had has given way to other associations: those of intellectual and cultural backwardness and unthinking adherence to violent ideologies. Here, as in all things, we are called upon to use our intelligence and discretion within the bounds of fixed principles.",222],[24,31,4,"4. Arabic: irba \u2014 skill, resourcefulness, cleverness, smartness. Lane (p. 45) records the meaning here at 24:31 as idiots, or persons deficient in intelligence.

They are not to walk in a way that is sexually provocative.

As with many elliptical statements, the omission is itself a boon, since the overt statement would increase burdens upon men. Muhammad Asad both discerns a similar sense and confirms the position here which is that concubinage outside of marriage is not condoned by the Qur\u2019an. He notes here: Lit., \u201cif they desire protection against unchastity (tahassun)\u201d, i.e , through marriage (cf. the expression muhsanat as used in 4:24). Most of the classical commentators are of the opinion that the term fatayat (\u201cmaidens\u201d) denotes here \u201cslave-girls\u201d: an assumption which is fully warranted by the context, Hence, the above verse reiterates the prohibition of concubinage by explicitly describing it as \u201cwhoredom\u201d (bigha\u2019).",340],[24,33,6,"6.

Abdullah Yusuf Ali makes a delightful comment here which I reproduce in full: The first three points in the Parable centre round the symbols of the Niche, the Lamp, and the Glass. (1) The Niche (Mishkah) is the little shallow recess in the wall of an Eastern house, fairly high from the ground, in which a light (before the days of electricity) was usually placed. Its height enabled it to diffuse the light in the room and minimised the shadows. The background of the wall and the sides of the niche helped throw the light well into the room, and if the wall was white-washed, it also acted as a reflector: the opening in front made the way for the light. So with the spiritual Light: it is placed high above worldly things: it has a niche or habitation of its own, in Revelation and other Signs of God; its access to men is by a special Way, open to all, yet closed to those who refuse its rays. (2) The Lamp is the core of the spiritual Truth, which is the real illumination; the Niche is nothing without it; the Niche is actually made for it. (3) The Glass is the transparent medium through which the Light passes. On the one hand, it protects the light from moths and other forms of low life (lower motives in man) and from gusts of wind (passions), and on the other, it transmits the light through a medium which is made up of and akin to the grosser substances of the earth (such as sand, soda, potash, etc.), so arranged as to admit the subtle to the gross by its transparency. So the spiritual Truth has to be filtered through human language or human intelligence to make it intelligible to mankind.",127],[24,36,1,"1. Translations typically bend this word into conformity with Traditionalist objectives such as mosque. But the word here is houses (Arabic: buy\u016bt), a standard word for describing those places in which men live. The Traditionalist wants a value of mosque because his dominant concern in presenting the Qur\u2019an is to create the impression in the mind of the reader of a connection between it and his religion. Here is the translation by Saheeh International (which is typical of Traditionalist ideology, and moderate ideologically) of the opening part of this verse: [Such niches are] in houses [i.e., mosques]. The translators have inserted the value they wish the reader to absorb in place of houses (namely, mosques).

Firstly, \u2018His command\u2019 follows mention of God, and most probably applies to God. But even if one does not accept that reading, the verse following serves as a severe implied warning not to follow doubtful sources (and the only text which all Muslims of the world accept is the Qur\u2019an). And, lastly, if one rejects both these points, there is no denying that it is inconsistent to take this imperative literally today (albeit by ascribing force of Mu\u1e25ammad\u2019s command to books written by others centuries later) when what precedes this statement treats of a time in which Mu\u1e25ammad was alive (so why then do those who read as Hilali & Khan suggest not also ask leave of Mu\u1e25ammad to withdraw?).

Or to obtain victory; i.e. against the punishment to come. While I comply with the typical rendering of this noun in the translation, I see a case here for na\u1e63r as victory (or to obtain victory as it would be as an object of the verb to be able). Under that reading, the sense is that those addressed can neither avert the punishment to come, nor defeat it by any means. I have parsed this segment outside of the direct speech which opens the verse; this draws the narrative back to the present \u2014 the context in which this reading has relevance. I mention Muhammad Asad\u2019s approach \u2014 which is similar to that taken here \u2014 in a note to this verse above. Other translators seem divided along lines of worldview, with non-sectarians N. J. Dawood and A. J. Arberry opening in the prophetic past, and then moving briskly to the present tense as do I (e.g. A. J. Arberry: So they cried lies touching the things you say, and you can neither turn it aside, nor find any help. Whosoever of you does evil, We shall let him taste a great chastisement.) Meanwhile, Traditionalists Saheeh International and Hilali & Khan render the opening with a future aspect which then also falls back quickly to the present (e.g. Hilali & Khan: Thus they (false gods all deities other than Allah) will give you (polytheists) the lie regarding what you say (that they are gods besides Allah), then you can neither avert (the punishment), nor get help. And whoever among you does wrong (i.e. sets up rivals to Allah), We shall make him taste a great torment). See also notes to this verse above.",98],[25,20,1,"1. Arabic: fitnah.

And they (angels) will say: \u201cAll kinds of glad tidings are forbidden for you,\u201d [None will be allowed to enter Paradise except the one who said: La ilaha ill-Allah, \u201c(none has the right to be worshipped but Allah) and acted practically on its legal orders and obligations].

Violent and emotional protestations by excitable persons notwithstanding, this verse is fully realised in the actions of those who claim to be the people of Mu\u1e25ammad. As a generalisation, they sing the Qur\u2019an \u2014 sometimes very nicely \u2014 but they treat the book itself as a relic; in terms of practicalities it is abandoned in favour of traditions, inventions, man-made isms, etc. The Qur\u2019an is not, as supposed, the foundation of the religion called Islam; were it fully removed, apart from the loss of the daily liturgy in which the Traditionalist reminds God of some small part of what He gave men to live by, there would be no discernible difference to the religion as commonly understood and practiced. For context my reading of this verse is the one accepted by the Traditionalist himself. The Traditionalist translators at Saheeh International \u2014 with no apparent cognisance of irony \u2014 supply the following note to the end of this verse: i.e., avoiding it, not listening to or understanding it, not living by it, or preferring something else to it.

This is, clearly, speculation \u2014 albeit speculation consistent with the broader narrative and usage found in the Qur\u2019an, but I render as is common in the translation and confine my views to the notes. While I am neutral on Muhammad Asad\u2019s assertions here, I repeat part of his note on this point for interest: As for Al-Rass, a town of that name exists to this day in the Central-Arabian province of Al-Qasim; in the ancient times referred to it seems to have been inhabited by descendants of the Nabataean tribe of Thamud (Tabari).

I have rendered here tersely, and in conformity with the principles which guide the broader translation, to the best of my ability. However, the reader should know that readings of this verse vary markedly. My own reading is closest to that of A. J. Arberry, who renders: thereafter We seize it to Ourselves, drawing it gently; but N. J. Dawood has: little by little We shorten them; Saheeh International has: Then We hold it in hand for a brief grasp, augmented by a note which reads: i.e., when the sun is overhead at noon; Hilali & Khan have: Then We withdraw it to Us a gradual concealed withdrawal; and Muhammad Asad has: and then, [after having caused it to lengthen,] We draw it in towards Ourselves with a gradual drawing-in, which he augments with a note: I.e., \u201cWe cause it to contract in accordance with the \u2018laws of nature\u2019 which We Ourselves have instituted.\u201d As in so many other instances in the Qur\u2019an, the abrupt change from the third-person pronoun \u201cHe\u201d to \u201cWe\u201d is meant to illustrate the fact that God is undefinable, and that it is only the inadequacy of human speech - and, hence, of the human mind - that makes it necessary to refer to the Supreme Being by pronouns which in reality are applicable only to finite-created \u201cpersons\u201d.",47],[25,48,1,"1.

Saheeh International, for example, has here: so ask about Him one well informed [i.e., the Prophet (\u1e63)]. Hilali & Khan, however, do not take this tack, and render: Ask Him (O Prophet Muhammad SAW), (concerning His Qualities, His rising over His Throne, His creations, etc.), as He is Al-Khabir (The All-Knower of everything i.e. Allah). Muhammad Asad is closest in his reasoning to what we present in this work, and supplies the following comment: I.e., \u201cask God Himself\u201d: since He alone holds the keys to the mysteries of the universe, it is only by observing His creation and listening to His revealed messages that man can obtain a glimpse, however distant, of God\u2019s Own reality.",169],[25,60,1,"1.

But now you have indeed denied (Him). So the torment will be yours for ever (inseparable permanent punishment).\u201d Meanwhile, N. J. Dawood takes a different view, especially of the opening clause: Say: \u2018Little cares my Lord if you do not invoke Him. Now that you have denied His revelations, His punishment is bound to overtake you.\u2019",80],[25,77,2,"2.

Sometimes (as, e.g., in 11:59 or 14:15) this term is used to describe a person\u2019s negative ethical attitude, and in that case it may be rendered as \u201cenemy of the truth\u201d.

The Qur\u2019an does not treat sodomites as victims of genetics, or of anything else; it presents them as transgressors (26:166) and as people expressing an irrational choice (11:78) \u2014 one born of ignorance (27:55). It reproves them as transgressors, much in the same way as it reproves transgressors of a number of types (political, economic, and so forth). There is no question but that male homosexual acts are wrong within the purview of the Qur\u2019an. However, one should remember that those who practice sodomy are under no compulsion to be believers themselves (cf. 2:256). Logically, should a particular man be a believer but find himself afflicted with drives he chooses to regard as too powerful to control, should he wish to renounce his faith in favour of sodomy, that is nobody\u2019s business but his own so long as he does not impact the believing society with his sin. The Qur\u2019an safeguards people\u2019s privacy in their homes against prying persons (24:27, 24:61), a right a sodomite should enjoy as much as anyone else. Within the Qur\u2019anic jurisprudence binding upon believers, then, male-on-male penetrative sex is sexual immorality, fundamentally wrong, and taboo. It logically falls under the same legislation and punitive requirements as sexual intercourse outside marriage of any other type (marriage being recognised only between one male and up to four females). However, the Qur\u2019anic mood is not one of instant and total condemnation; comparable contexts suggest that wrong action should be discouraged and reproved by friends and \u2018let be\u2019 if people repent and reform (cf. 4:16-17), and there can be punishment only when specific circumstances are met (cf. 24:2). Additionally, one should remember that Ibr\u0101h\u012bm entreated God on behalf of the city of L\u016b\u1e6d (11:74), and L\u016b\u1e6d himself reproved his people before he left and they were punished. The Qur\u2019an does not say that sin is not sin; but neither does it strain to cast the first stone \u2014 or, in fact, any stones \u2014 despite what the Traditionalist contends, in this case or in any other. See 24:10, 24:14, 24:20 (which treat of sexual contexts) for reminders that we are all in need of God\u2019s mercy. See Notepad XXII.",107],[26,168,1,"1.

One of the functions of the Qur\u2019an is to correct calumnies levelled against the prophets in the corrupted texts of previous peoples. Chapter 19 of Genesis has it that Lot (L\u016b\u1e6d) committed incest with his daughters after leaving the city \u2014 to ensure (as one is given to understand) the continuance of the family line due to a dearth of males in the new location; the daughters\u2019 argument rings hollow given that the males of the city they had fled could not have provided issue in any case (a point alluded to at 11:78-79). More convincing, perhaps, would be an argument for the need to raise up further children to Lot (L\u016b\u1e6d) on the grounds that his wife was now dead, but such an argument is closed down by the Qur\u2019an which states explicitly his wife was an \u2018old woman.\u2019 Thus, the Talmudic-sounding \u2018justification\u2019 found at Genesis 19 for incest is refuted on whatever basis it might be advanced: L\u016b\u1e6d\u2019s wife had been past child-bearing age, thus it made no difference from the point of view of procreation that she was now dead; and the men of the city of L\u016b\u1e6d were not potential husbands for his daughters, thus the dearth of eligible men in the scenario following that of the destruction of the city of L\u016b\u1e6d was \u2014 in this regard at least \u2014 no different to that which preceded it. The primary function of the Book of Genesis in its current condition is to create and promote a programme of racial survival and supremacy, and is a composite of different accounts, and was probably constructed by Ezra before or after release from Babylon.

This verse is problematic for the Traditionalist as it doesn\u2019t quite say what he wants it to. Anyone who sees purpose in Creation and connects that purpose with a single Mind believes in God\u2019s proofs. If such a person submits to God, then this is someone the Messenger can reach \u2014 one\u2019s racial, cultural, or sectarian affiliations being irrelevant. To the Traditionalist, the Messenger\u2019s job was to convert people to the Traditionalist\u2019s religion. But that requirement is at odds with the text in this verse, so the Traditionalist tends to finesse the words to comport with his objective. For example, staunchly Traditionalist translators Hilali & Khan have here: Nor can you lead the blind out of their error, you can only make to hear those who believe in Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), and who have submitted (themselves to Allah in Islam as Muslims); and Traditionalist Saheeh International has: And you cannot guide the blind away from their error. You will only make hear those who believe in Our verses so they are Muslims [i.e., submitting to All\u0101h]. Neither provide any comment, no doubt feeling it best not to draw more attention than necessary to the tension \u2014 obvious to the attentive reader \u2014 between this verse and \u2018Islamic\u2019 ideology. Non-sectarians deal with the reader more honestly. N. J. Dawood has: nor can you guide the blind out of their error. None shall give ear to you save those who believe in Our revelations and are submissive to Our will; while A. J.

Since at the time in question the cult of Amon was paramount in Egypt, his high priest held a rank second only to that of the reigning Pharaoh. The assumption that the person spoken of in the Qur\u2019an as Haman was indeed the high priest of the cult of Amon is strengthened by Pharaoh\u2019s demand (mentioned in verse 38 of this surah as well as in 40:36-37) that Haman erect for him \u201ca lofty tower\u201d from which he could \u201chave a look at [or \u201cascend to\u201d] the god of Moses\u201d: which may be, among other things, an allusion to the hieratic purpose of the great pyramids of Egypt and to the function of the high priest as their chief architect.",65],[28,6,3,"3.

It is my view that M\u016bs\u0101 had killed one of his own people, though that is not what is claimed in the Hebrew scriptures or by the Traditionalist Muslim (see my book The God Protocol for my reasons). The Arabic here can mean, as commonly read \u2014 and as I render myself \u2014 among them. However, the meaning is ambiguous. It could mean of theirs in the sense of one of their number; but the same wording can mean among them, or in their midst. Examples of a possessive sense for min are found at 69:18 (no secret among you \u2014 i.e. no secret of yours \u2014 will be hidden; Arabic: l\u0101 takhf\u0101 min kum kh\u0101fiya), and at 19:4 minn\u012b simply means mine or my, as it does also at 20:39 and 20:123. Read thus, the line here means: I killed a soul of theirs (i.e. belonging to them); and at this point in the narrative, the children of Israel belonged fully to Fir\u02bfawn and his ruling caste as slaves. But min can also denote effect. It is seen at 2:273 (because of or due to reticence; Arabic: min al ta\u02bfaffuf), and at 4:102 (because of or due to rain; Arabic: min ma\u1e6dar). Additionally, Farid\u2019s Dictionary of Qur\u2019an (p. 759) notes by reason of as a value for the particle min. It gives 71:25 as an example (because of \u2014 i.e. as a result of \u2014 their sinning errors they were drowned; Arabic: minm\u0101 kha\u1e6dy\u0101\u2019\u0101tihim ughriq\u016b). Read thus, the line here means: I killed a soul due to them (i.e. as a result of their actions). Penrice\u2019s Dictionary and Glossary of the Quran (p. 141) includes by reason of, but also lists after the manner of as a value for min. The first category we have looked at; as concerns the second category, min features frequently as part of the adverbial phrase min \u1e25aythu. This adverbial convention occurs at 2:149, 2:150, 2:191, 2:199, 2:222, 7:19, 7:27, 7:182, 12:68, 16:26, 16:45, 39:25, 59:2, 65:3, 65:6, 68:44. Comparison of all instances reveals it to have the two main functions: 1. from wherever, from whence, whence (e.g. 2:149, 2:150, 2:191), 2. in what manner; in accordance with how; in what manner it be that (e.g. 2:222, 12:68, 65:5). All instances appear in the notes and reference 2:149. Read thus, the line here means: I killed a soul (just) like them (i.e. in the manner that they kill souls). We turn now to consider which of these options is the most likely. Reading beyond the clause under consideration, we encounter M\u016bs\u0101\u2019s concern that Fir\u02bfawn\u2019s people will kill him. Thus, killing is the dominant thread within the verse, and \u2018like them\u2019 is the option in closest keeping with that thread. Additionally, the Qur\u2019an states three times that Fir\u02bfawn killed the males among the children of Israel (2:49, 7:141, 14:6); thus by killing a male among the children of Israel M\u016bs\u0101 committed an act which was precisely \u2018like them\u2019. On that basis, my view is that \u2018like them\u2019 is a likely reading; but in terms of strict grammar (since the word here is min and not min \u1e25aythu, the case is strong also for the possessive, namely: I killed a soul of theirs (i.e. belonging to them, and which they legally possessed). However, I have rendered in the translation using the common convention of among them, a formulation which itself is ambiguous as discussed above, and I confine further thoughts to the notes. See notes to 28:15-19.",46],[28,34,1,"1. My view is that M\u016bs\u0101 killed one of the children of Israel; in such a scenario it would be natural for them to deny him also.",139],[28,35,1,"1.

Muhammad Asad expresses an interesting point at this juncture: Some of the classical commentators incline to interpret the ma in the phrase ma kana lahum al-khirah as a particle of negation and the noun khirah as \u201cchoice\u201d or \u201cfreedom of choice\u201d, thus giving to this phrase the meaning of \u201cHe chooses, [but] they [i.e., human beings] have no freedom of choice\u201d. To my mind, however, this interpretation conflicts not only with the immediately preceding passages but with the tenor of the Qur\u2019an as a whole, which insists throughout on man\u2019s responsibility for (and, hence, on relative freedom in) choosing between right and wrong - and this side by side with its stress on God\u2019s unlimited power to determine the factual course of events. Hence, I prefer to base my rendering on the interpretation advanced and convincingly argued by Tabari, who regards the crucial particle ma not as a negation but as a relative pronoun synonymous with alladhi (\u201cthat which\u201d or \u201cwhatever\u201d), and understands the noun khirah in its primary significance of \u201cthat which is chosen\u201d or \u201cpreferred\u201d, i.e., because it is considered to be the best: in another word, as a synonym of khayr. Zamakhshari refers to this interpretation with evident approval (without, however, mentioning Tabari specifically), and enlarges upon it thus: \u201cGod chooses for mankind whatever is best (ma huwa khayr) and most beneficial (aslah) for them, for He knows better than they themselves do what is good for them.\u201d",79],[28,68,2,"2.

I suppose one could argue that since parts of the Qur\u2019an are recited during the ritual, the recital of the Qur\u2019an itself forbids such actions. But it is perfectly possible to execute the Traditionalist\u2019s ritual without mentioning such verses, and in any case the majority of those who perform it do not understand what they are saying (cf. 4:43) because the Traditionalist has convinced them that Arabic is a magic language, and that it is important to God to have people unthinkingly recite back to Him the instructions He gave them to live by.

However, my soul recognises and responds to the truths contained in that doctrine which is implicit and explicit in the Qur\u2019an. But these truths do not presuppose any sort of religion (if by religion we mean choosing to believe something one knows to be wholly or partially untrue, patching over the shortfall by drowning out experiential data on the basis of learned dogma). As we say in English: the devil is in the details. And, as the Traditionalist is so fond of pointing out, the Qur\u2019an does not provide \u2018the details\u2019. The Traditionalist argues that the Qur\u2019an is deficient (a condition which can be corrected by means of his preferred literature); for my part, I argue that the Qur\u2019an does not envisage a religion in the sense that the Traditionalist means it (or at least in the sense that I think he means it given what I see him do with what he claims to believe). There is nothing wrong with choosing a particular implementation of those basic principles one finds in the Qur\u2019an and creating a jurisprudence around them; there is everything wrong with insisting that the methods one chooses to employ are themselves ordained by God when they have no explicit basis in the Qur\u2019an; cf. 12:40.",78],[30,30,5,"5.

In summary, his assertion (see also 58:1-4) is that pre-Islamic Arabs would divorce their wives by saying that a wife was \u2018like the back of\u2019 his mother, and that it is this practice which the verb at this juncture (rendered by me as assist) references. No support is found for this assertion in the text itself, we are expected simply to take the Traditionalist\u2019s word for it. Facts first: the form III verb based on \u1e93ahara objectively and correctly means to assist, to help, to aid, to support \u2014 and the Traditionalist himself renders this form III verb in just this sense in all other instances outside of this specific context and its adjunct at 58:1-4 (see 9:4, 33:26, 60:9). Allowing the verb its natural meaning (i.e. that of assisting among your wives) fits the context exactly. The Qur\u2019anic redress for those who swear off their wives (which is what the Traditionalist is claiming as the sense here though by another name) is entirely different and comprehensively treated at 2:226. Now to the application of reason: in a context which permits of limited polygeny a situation is possible in which one wife might not be able to have children while others might be able to have them. In such a case, a man \u2014 it may be reasoned \u2014 might decide (it is assumed within the Qur\u2019anic principle of mutual consultation) to \u2018assist\u2019 both the fertile and infertile wives by allowing the infertile wife to raise a child born to the fertile wife. Thus, the infertile wife might experience something of the joys of motherhood, and the fertile wife \u2014 who may already have her hands full with existing children \u2014 might get support in the raising of a child. (Other comparable scenarios are where the husband has a child from a previous wife, or a wife brings an existing child into a marriage.) The point in such scenarios (i.e. in which a man \u2018assists\u2019 among his wives) is that we should remember who the true mother is and not obfuscate that fact. These points granted, it is possible to envisage a case in which a man has allowed a wife to raise a child of which she is not the natural mother, and that that decision has resulted either in regret on the part of the natural mother or in a change of mind on the part of the man. It is surely such a case which is the subject here, i.e. one in which a man has to go back on this arrangement (returning a child to the care of its natural mother, thus depriving the adoptive mother of her charge). This scenario is addressed also at 58:1-4, to which the present verse forms an adjunct.",119],[33,4,3,"3.

On the other hand, it is obvious that both passages have basically a similar (namely, spiritual) import - with the difference only that whereas the concluding sentences of Al-Anfal refer to the brotherhood of all believers in general, the present passage lays stress on the yet deeper, special relationship between every true believer and God\u2019s Apostle.",205],[33,6,8,"8.

The reader should be aware that the Traditionalist makes specious claims for wisdom (\u1e25ikma) as found here, ascribing to it on the basis of no Qur\u2019anic evidence a value (here specifically, but at other times when it suits him) equal to those collections of a later and extraneous literature which he follows in preference to the revelation of God. The absence of any basis in the Qur\u2019an for his claim may be demonstrated by comparing and considering all instances of this word as found therein: 2:129, 2:151, 2:231, 2:251, 2:269, 2:269, 3:48, 3:81, 3:164, 4:54, 4:113, 5:110, 16:125, 17:39, 31:12, 33:34, 38:20, 43:63, 54:5, 62:2 all of which have a note which references this verse. The operative verb here in any case is the passive mood of recite, and recite always relates to something read out or repeated from memory, so wisdom in this instance must \u2014 along with proofs of God \u2014 refer to something of that type. The Traditionalist has conflated the concept of a verse in the Qur\u2019an with that of a proof (\u0101ya). To him all verses are proofs. However, the preponderance of evidence is that this is not correct. Some verses (or collections thereof) are proofs, others are wisdom; yet others comprise law. While I do not claim that such distinctions are mutually exclusive, I think it is safe to say that not every verse is in itself a proof if for no other reason than the fact that the verse divisions do not comprise part of the revelation, they were decided upon by men.",84],[33,35,1,"1.

The convention \u2018God and His messenger\u2019 is appealed to ad nauseam by the Traditionalist to lend credence to his religion, one he himself admits, when pressed, to be largely \u2014 if not entirely \u2014 absent from the Qur\u2019an. The Traditionalist would have us make three assumptions: firstly, that the actions of Mu\u1e25ammad the man constitute those of \u2018the Messenger\u2019; secondly, that the mass of stories ascribed to Mu\u1e25ammad by Persian scribes centuries after his life constitute a reliable historical record of Mu\u1e25ammad\u2019s actions; thirdly, that the expression \u2018obey God and His messenger\u2019 indicates a Qur\u2019anic requirement for incorporating this extra-Qur\u2019anic library into the process of understanding what God requires of those believers who accept the Qur\u2019an. Regarding the first point, we should note that a careful reading of the present surrounding context makes clear that whatever is meant in the Qur\u2019an by \u2018God and His messenger\u2019 applied here also to Mu\u1e25ammad (what follows at 33:37 serves to bring Mu\u1e25ammad himself into compliance with Qur\u2019anic directives since one clearly detects, in the third and fourth clauses of 33:37, a reluctance on the part of Mu\u1e25ammad \u2014 one which, in that context, may logically be taken only to indicate unwillingness to act on the Qur\u2019anic judgment that the divorced wife of an adopted son may legally be taken to wife \u2014 a point which is implicit at 33:4). This assertion finds support in \u2018command\u2019 (Arabic: \u2018amr) \u2014 which word comprises the key note of the main argument \u2014 at the end of 33:37. Thus, Mu\u1e25ammad the man \u2014 as a believing man (cf. first clause of 33:36) \u2014 is obliged to obey \u2018God and His messenger\u2019. This fact renders the Traditionalist\u2019s first assumption false, which \u2014 when owned \u2014 leaves his second and third redundant.",247],[33,37,1,"1.

Ellipsis is required, in my opinion, by dint of both the context and the structure. What \u2018God reveals\u2019 can, in the context, treat of one thing only: the approaching point that the divorced wife of an adopted son may legally be taken to wife, (which is implicit at 33:4 also). Before taking up arms against the suggestion that Mu\u1e25ammad could in any way err, one should consider the following Qur\u2019anic verses: 6:34-35, 8:67-68, 9:43, 9:113, 17:73-75, 18:23-24, 48:2, 66:1, 80:1-2, 93:7.",200],[33,37,3,"3.

At this point the Traditionalist\u2019s value for \u1e63all\u0101 as a verb denoting the performance of a five-times daily ritual found nowhere in the Qur\u2019an fails him and he renders the verb in this instance as to bless or to send blessings.

Hilali & Khan\u2019s translation of the present verse will demonstrate the general tendency: He it is Who sends Salat (His blessings) on you, and His angels too (ask Allah to bless and forgive you), that He may bring you out from darkness (of disbelief and polytheism) into light (of Belief and Islamic Monotheism). And He is Ever Most Merciful to the believers.

Here Traditionalist translators emphasise harm (at least potentially or latently) to be inflicted by the recipient of the Qur\u2019an upon those listed, whereas non-sectarians read this phrase as do I: that he is not to pay heed to hindrances inflicted upon him by those listed. To take the Traditionalists first: Saheeh International has here: And do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites but do not harm them; and Hilali & Khan have: And obey not the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and harm them not (till you are ordered). In the non-sectarian camp, N. J. Dawood renders: Do not yield to the unbelievers and the hypocrites: disregard their insolence; and A. J. Arberry has: And obey not the unbelievers and the hypocrites; heed not their hurt. The pivotal word here is in Arabic wada\u02bf \u2014 comprising the conjunction wa and the second-person masculine singular imperative of the form I verb wada\u02bfa. As in so many cases where the Traditionalist puts a dissonant spin on the text, the word he leverages is found only once in the text. However, the form II is also found (and means to forsake) which should imply support for to disregard. That word occurs once at 93:3 and is rendered there by Saheeh International take leave of and by Hilali & Khan to forsake. Additionally, Wehr (p. 1240) lists the meanings for the form I verb wada\u02bfa as: to put down; to let, leave; to leave off, stop, cease; to give up, omit, skip. Arabic root: \u2018-dh-y.

The Traditionalist forwards a number of calumnious claims against the Prophet, including that of marriage to a child, and of taking more wives than the number allowed by the Qur\u2019an. Such claims find no support in the Qur\u2019an. Supporters of the idea that Mu\u1e25ammad took many wives must ignore the fact that the operative word at 33:52 is exchange; if the Prophet were not bound by the Qur\u2019anic limit of four wives he could merely have added (rather than exchanged) wives.

Generically, \u1e63all\u0101 means to perform (the or one\u2019s) duty. The duty binding upon the believers in the current context begins at 33:50 (to arrive on time and not to enter the Prophet\u2019s house early). With this comes the injunction to greet with a salutation (that is: loudly and clearly to announce one\u2019s presence before entering his house, and not to enter it without permission) for the purposes of protecting the modesty of the occupants, but also that there be no doubt as to the chastity of a wife (for reasons which in this context include ensuring complete moral transparency and integrity in the houses of the Prophet). The Qur\u2019an does not say we are to greet the Prophet \u2014 though the Traditionalist assumes that it does, and often \u2018translates\u2019 accordingly; it says we are to greet with a salutation. In recognition of the lamentable and undeniable need to overstate the obvious, I would add that the Prophet is now dead. Just as there is today no need to arrive at his house on time, there is also no need to greet either him or his wives. The Traditionalist\u2019s practice of pouring honorifics upon a dead man and \u2018greeting\u2019 him as part of his prayer ritual has no basis in the Qur\u2019an, is a clear case of shirk, and borders on necromancy. This sort of deviation from clear and obvious good sense is one result of accepting values for Qur\u2019anic terms derived from an external, extraneous literature. By way of example of how this verse has been abused by the Traditionalist, Hilali & Khan\u2019s rendering of 33:56 follows: Allah sends His Salat (Graces, Honours, Blessings, Mercy, etc.) on the Prophet (Muhammad SAW) and also His angels too (ask Allah to bless and forgive him). O you who believe! Send your Salat on (ask Allah to bless) him (Muhammad SAW), and (you should) greet (salute) him with the Islamic way of greeting (salutation i.e. AsSalamu \u2018Alaikum).",95],[33,56,4,"4. It is a revealed principle to greet each person with a greeting at least as good as one receives (4:86). The context here (33:53 onwards) is one in which the Prophet is alive. The allusion is to 24:27-30, 24:60 which verses supply the etiquette for entering people\u2019s houses.",133],[33,57,1,"1. Arabic root: \u2018-dh-y. See Notepad X.",16],[33,58,1,"1.

The date of that catastrophe cannot be established with any certainty, but the most probable period of the first bursting of the Dam of Ma\u2019rib seems to have been the second century of the Christian era. The kingdom of Sheba was largely devastated, and this led to the migration of many southern (Qahtan) tribes towards the north of the Peninsula. Subsequently, it appears, the system of dams and dykes was to some extent repaired, but the country never regained its earlier prosperity; and a few decades before the advent of Islam the great dam collapsed completely and finally. This may reasonably be claimed by the Arabia Felix thesis as a point in its favour (see Notepad XVI).",68],[34,17,1,"1. I.e. Does God thus reward?",59],[34,18,1,"1.

Both readings are possible.",128],[34,19,1,"1. There are two readings here; I have opted for the second based on what I see as the superior reasoning of Muhammad Asad, but I will provide the reader both scenarios. One common reading, as given by Abdullah Yusuf Ali, is: But they said, \u201cOur Lord! Place longer distances between our journey-stages[...]. His comment, reproduced in full is: The people of Saba were given every chance. They had prosperity, skill, trade and commerce, and a healthy and beautiful country. They also had, apparently, great virtues, and as long as they remained true to their virtues, i.e., to the law of God, they remained happy and contented. But when they became covetous and selfish, and became jealous of other people\u2019s prosperity instead of rejoicing in it, they fell from grace and declined. It may be that the climate changed, the rainfall became scantier, perhaps on account of the cutting down of hill forests: trade routes changed, on account of the people falling off in the virtues that make men popular: behind all the physical causes was the root-cause, that they began to worship mammon, self, greed, or materialism. They fell into the snare of Satan. They gradually passed out of history, and became only a name in a story. Moral: it is only God\u2019s Mercy that can give true happiness or prosperity, and happiness or prosperity is only a snare unless used for the highest service of God and man. As mentioned, incline towards the reasoning and reading of Muhammad Asad whose comment at this point I also reproduce in full: In its generally-accepted spelling - based on the reading adopted by most of the early scholars of Medina and Kufah - the above phrase reads in the vocative rabbana and the imperative ba\u2019id (\u201cOur Sustainer! Make long the distances ...\u201d, etc.), which, however, cannot be convincingly explained. On the other hand, Tabari, Baghawi and Zamakhshari mention, on the authority of some of the earliest Qur\u2019an-commentators, another legitimate reading of the relevant words, namely, rabbuna (in the nominative) and ba\u2019ada (in the indicative), which gives the meaning adopted by me: \u201cLong has our Sustainer made the distances ...\u201d, etc. To my mind, this reading is much more appropriate since (as pointed out by Zamakhshari) it expresses the belated regrets and the sorrow of the people of Sheba at the devastation of their country, the exodus of large groups of the population, and the resultant abandonment of many towns and villages on the great caravan routes.",74],[34,19,2,"2.

Whereas most of the classical commentators are of the opinion that the term al-jinnah denotes here the angels, since they - like all beings of this category - are imperceptible to man\u2019s senses, I believe that the above verse refers to those intangible forces of nature which elude all direct observation and manifest themselves only in their effects: hence their designation, in this context, by the plural noun al-jinnah, which primarily denotes \u201cthat which is concealed from [man\u2019s] senses\u201d. Inasmuch as people who refuse to believe in God often tend to regard those elemental forces as mysteriously endowed with a purposeful creative power (cf. Bergson\u2019s concept of the elan vital), the Qur\u2019an states that their votaries invent a \u201ckinship\u201d between them and God, i.e., attribute to them qualities and powers similar to His.",44],[37,158,2,"2.

This is a pivotal, crucial clause and absent any methodical approach to textual values has resulted in wild guessing as to its meaning. A. J. Arberry has: A very host of parties is routed there! M.K. Shakir has: A host of deserters of the allies shall be here put to flight. Muhammad Asad has: [But] there it is: any and all human beings, however [strongly] leagued together, are bound to suffer defeat [whenever they refuse to accept the truth]. N. J. Dawood has: Their faction is no more than a beaten army. Saheeh International has: [They are but] soldiers [who will be] defeated there among the companies [of disbelievers]. And Abdullah Yusuf Ali has: But there - will be put to flight even a host of confederates. The translators cited understand two things: 1. that there is a host of some kind and 2. that this host is defeated. What their presentations lack is any demonstration of the import of \u2014 and connection between \u2014 these two facts. Part of their problem is that they are trying to work blind: they have no pan-textual method; they do not understand the system of Qur\u2019anic definitions; they do not understand the function of bal in 38:8 or of the hanging am at 38:9-10, and on top of that they are obliged to deal with the sandstorm of the Traditionalist\u2019s extraneous narrative interpolation. Under such circumstances it would be surprising if they were able to demonstrate any clarity. I will unpick the present clause within the framework of the methodology used here before going on to demonstrate what it means. Firstly, jund is a collective noun rendered force throughout (19:75, 36:28, 36:75, 37:173, 38:11, 44:24, 67:20) and indicates a group directed towards an aim of some kind, usually \u2014 though not always \u2014 with a military aspect; secondly, hun\u0101lika means there (at that place) or thereupon and is rendered in this second mode throughout (3:38, 7:119, 10:30, 18:44, 25:13, 33:11, 38:11, 40:78, 40:85); thirdly, we have the verb hazama. It occurs twice as a verb (2:251, 54:45) and once (here) as a passive participle. The first instance of the verb treats of the victory of the children of Israel under \u1e6c\u0101l\u016bt (in which D\u0101w\u016bd slew J\u0101l\u016bt), while the second instance treats of the inevitability of victory over the forces of denial (after a rehearsal of the defeat of Fir\u02bfawn). Hence, both contexts unquestionably treat of defeat, which may safely be relied upon as the value here (in passive mode). Fourthly, the plural noun al a\u1e25z\u0101b is rendered here as the parties throughout. A careful reading of all instances (11:17, 13:36, 19:37, 33:20, 33:20, 33:22, 38:11, 38:13, 40:30, 43:65) makes clear that this term has a particular meaning: it denotes those groups or factions into which men fall based on their reaction to the message given by God. That is: al a\u1e25z\u0101b are those who encounter and (usually) reject the message brought by the Messenger (this point is made explicitly here at 38:12-14). We are left with the meaning of m\u0101 and min. The latter consistently means among or of and is rendered thus here. The particle m\u0101 (which follows junb) has a range of meanings. However, following an indefinite noun (as here) it means some, certain (for example yawman m\u0101 \u2014 some day, sometime in the future). On this basis we render: Some force is thereupon defeated among the parties. To understand what this means we need to understand that the tone and content of the lead-up from the beginning of the chapter treats of the confrontation and defeat of the ruling elite of the day. On a verse-by-verse basis: 38:1 evokes the Qur\u2019an; 38:2 states that those who ignore warning are lost; 38:3 reminds of the destruction of previous communities; 38:4-5 cite amazement at being warned by one of their own, and subsequent accusations against the message-bearer; 38:6-7 list initial strategies on the part of the ruling elite to refute the message; 38:8 gives a true assessment of the condition of those warned; 38:9-10 posit a challenge to two positions which fundamentally underpin the position supported by the ruling elite which is: then let them ascend into the causes! \u2014 i.e. let them make the heavens and the earth obey them (if they truly have dominion of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, etc.). However, the fact is that they do not have the treasures of the mercies of God nor do they have the dominion of the heavens and the earth (cf. 38:9-10); they have smoke, mirrors and threats. Thus, they and their claims are exposed. The crucial import of 38:11 lies in the fact that it is at this point (i.e. having taken the argument to this juncture) that some force is thereupon defeated among the parties. Under the aegis of the God Protocol (see my book The God Protocol) this juncture has legal significance. After this point, those who lead a community are guilty and that community is liable to punishment \u2014 a point made explicitly at 38:12-15. Cf. 39:71.",52],[38,12,1,"1. Arabic: fir\u02bfawn.

Some see it as an indication of comparison (for example, Saheeh International has here: And he said, \u201cIndeed, I gave preference to the love of good [things] over the remembrance of my Lord[...]). However, Muhammad Asad places the emphasis as have I, and supplies a note: Lit,, \u201cbecause of [or \u201cout of\u201d] (\u2018an) the remembrance of my Sustainer\u201d. Leaving linguistic points to one side, it seems some Traditionalists are ideologically committed to the reading they have here since at the next verse they have Sulaym\u0101n hacking his horses into pieces \u2014 something which is nowhere found in the Arabic (I am unable to supply their reasons). Abdullah Yusuf Ali comments here: The story is not found in the Old Testament. I interpret it to mean that, like his father David, Solomon was also most meticulous in not allowing the least motive of self to be mixed up with his spiritual virtues. He was fond of horses: he had great armies and wealth; but he used them all in God\u2019s service[...]. His battles were not fought for lust of blood, but as Jih\u0101ds in the cause of righteousness. His love of horses was not like that of a mere race-goer or of a warrior: there was a spiritual element in it. He loved by a kind of love which was spiritual\u2014the love of the highest Good.",46],[38,32,2,"2.

Grammar: the verb here is in the feminine singular, agreeing with shams (sun) which is obliquely referenced by virtue of the fact that we know that it is evening (\u02bfashiyya). Traditionalist interpretations for 38:31-33 vary. The facts as I see them are: Sulaym\u0101n loved horses out of love for God (seeing God\u2019s hand in their creation and maintenance); the sun then set (which indicated that it was time for prayer); Sulaym\u0101n stopped for prayer after which he asked for the horses to be brought back to him; he then anointed (or stroked or rubbed) their legs and necks.

While I do not share his pre-existing allegiance to the dominant Egypt-Palestine thesis (see Notepad XVI), I reproduce Abdullah Yusuf Ali\u2019s comments here in full: The body (without life) on his throne has been variously interpreted. The interpretation that appeals to me most is that his earthly power, great as it was, was like a body without a soul, unless it was vivified by God\u2019s spirit. But Solomon did turn to God in true devotion, and his real power lay there. He did his best to root out idolatry, and he completed the Temple in Jerusalem for the worship of the One True God. Cf. his conversion of Bilqis the Queen of Sheba, 27:40. See also 7:148, where the same word jasad is used in connection with the image of a calf which the Israelites had set up for worship in the absence of Moses. Men may worship worldly Power as they may worship an idol, and there is great temptation in such Power, though Solomon withstood such temptation[...]. Muhammad Asad\u2019s comment adds to those provided by Abdullah Yusuf Ali: To explain this verse, some of the commentators advance the most fantastic stories, almost all of them going back to Talmudic sources. Razi rejects them all, maintaining that they are unworthy of serious consideration. Instead, he plausibly suggests that the \u201cbody\u201d (jasad) upon Solomon\u2019s throne is an allusion to his own body, and - metonymically - to his kingly power, which was bound to remain \u201clifeless\u201d so long as it was not inspired by God-willed ethical values. (It is to be borne in mind that in classical Arabic a person utterly weakened by illness, worry or fear, or devoid of moral values, is often described as \u201ca body without a soul\u201d.) In other words, Solomon\u2019s early trial consisted in his inheriting no more than a kingly position, and it rested upon him to endow that position with spiritual essence and meaning.",78],[38,35,1,"1.

Curse God, and die.\u201d According to the classical Qur\u2019an-commentators, Job swore that, if God would restore him to health, he would punish her blasphemy with a hundred stripes. But when he did recover, he bitterly regretted his hasty oath, for he realized that his wife\u2019s \u201cblasphemy\u201d had been an outcome of her love and pity for him; and thereupon he was told in a revelation that he could fulfil his vow in a symbolic manner by striking her once with \u201ca bunch of grass containing a hundred blades or more\u201d. (Cf. 5:89 - \u201cGod will not take you to task for oaths which you may have uttered without thought.\u201d).

I supply Muhammad Asad\u2019s note with some light editing for interest: In all the eleven instances in which the noun \u2018adn occurs in the Qur\u2019an it is used as a qualifying term for the \u201cgardens\u201d (jannat) of paradise. This noun is derived from the verb \u2018adana, which primarily denotes \u201che remained [somewhere]\u201d or \u201che kept (to something]\u201d, i.e., permanently: cf, the phrase \u2018adantu \u2018l-balad (\u201cI remained for good [or \u201csettled\u201d] in the country\u201d). In Biblical Hebrew - which, after all, is but a very ancient Arabian dialect - the closely related noun \u2018eden has also the additional connotation of \u201cdelight\u201d, \u201cpleasure\u201d or \u201cbliss\u201d. Hence the combination of the two concepts in my rendering of \u2018adn as \u201cperpetual bliss\u201d. As in many other places in the Qur\u2019an, this bliss is here allegorized - and thus brought closer to man\u2019s imagination - by means of descriptions recalling earthly joys.",26],[38,52,1,"1.

Others (e.g., Tabari) see in it a reference to the polarity evident in all creation. Ibn \u2018Abbas (as quoted by Razi) says that it denotes the concept of opposites in general, like \u201csweet and sour, or white and black, or male and female\u201d; to which Razi adds that everything in creation has its complement, \u201clike high and low, right and left, front and back, past and future, being and attribute\u201d, etc., whereas God - and He alone - is unique, without anything that could be termed \u201copposite\u201d or \u201csimilar\u201d or \u201ccomplementary\u201d.

Arberry\u2019s rendering of the same clause: Whether We take thee away). The verb here is dhahaba which means simply to take away (i.e. from a place). It does not mean in Qur\u2019anic parlance to take away (in death), despite the fact that Saheeh International treats as though it did (rendering: And whether [or not] We take you away [in death]). There is a verb which is commonly rendered to take in this sense in English, but that does not feature here (the form V verb tawaff\u0101 which occurs as a verb at 2:234, 2:240, 3:193, 4:15, 4:97, 5:117, 6:60, 6:61, 7:37, 7:126, 8:50, 10:46, 10:104, 12:101, 13:40, 16:28, 16:32, 16:70, 22:5, 32:11, 39:42, 40:67, 40:77, 47:27 and in participle form at 3:55). The Traditionalist translators are here bending the text in the direction of their preferences; the actual point in the present verses is that were the Messenger to be expelled (cf. 47:13), destruction would become binding upon the rejecting community. It is clear from my analysis of the Qur\u2019an that this is what, in fact, happened in the case of Muhammad\u2019s primary mission (recognition of which fact exposes the Traditionalist\u2019s cult as both superfluous and idolatrous).

Dawood has: Thus did he incite his people; and Saheeh International has: So he bluffed his people.",12],[43,54,2,"2. Arabic root: f-s-q. See note to 2:26 and Notepad XI.vii.",69],[43,57,1,"1.

In my opinion, this is a disingenuous argument, one which assumes the premise it requires (in this case that \u02bf\u012as\u0101 was a \u2018god\u2019) in order to generate a predetermined reaction; it is a standard rhetorical device, known popularly as the Straw Man. One sees it used in debates of all kinds, including by professional atheists and religionists today.

Some think this pronoun refers to him (\u02bf\u012as\u0101). I am not among them. Such a view suggests a lack of familiarity with the broader text (see 31:34, 41:47, 43:66, 43:85). Rather, I agree with those who understand the reference to be to the Qur\u2019an. Among the features concerning the Hour which the Qur\u2019an emphasises is that it is certainly coming, and that no one knows precisely when it will befall but God alone. Incidentally, we find the following words ascribed to Jesus in the Book of Matthew: But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only (Matt. 24:36). I render the substance of this verse exactly as does Arabist A. J. Arberry. Muhammad Asad notes here: Whereas most of the commentators regard the pronoun hu in innahu as relating to Jesus and, consequently, interpret the above phrase as \u201che is indeed a means to know [i.e., an indication of the coming of] the Last Hour\u201d, some authorities - e.g., Qatadah, Al-Hasan al-Basri and Sa\u2019id ibn Jubayr (all of them quoted by Tabari, Baghawi and Ibn Kathir) - relate the pronoun to the Qur\u2019an[...]. The specific mention of the Last Hour in the above context is meant to stress man\u2019s ultimate responsibility before the Creator and, therefore, the fact that worship is due to Him alone: and so this parenthetic passage follows logically upon the mention of the false deification of Jesus.",6],[43,61,2,"2.

Tropically, it connotes the act of \u201cestablishing\u201d or \u201cdetermining\u201d a thing, a proposition, a course of events, etc. (Jawhari). According to the Lisan al-\u2019Arab, the phrase abrama al-amr has the meaning of \u201che determined (ahkama) the case\u201d. In the present context, the term amr, having no definite article, signifies \u201canything\u201d or - in its widest sense - \u201canything that should [or \u201ccould\u201d] be\u201d: and so, taking the preceding verse into account, we arrive at the meaning of arbitrarily \u201cdetermining what [the truth] should be\u201d - i.e., in contradiction to what the Qur\u2019an postulates as the truth.",18],[43,79,3,"3.

Muhammad Asad, meanwhile, offers a different perspective: Razi (on whose commentary the above interpolation is based), regards this as a reference to the Prophet Muhammad.

Meanwhile, the massive propaganda against the Qur\u2019an originating in the actions of \u2018terrorist\u2019 groups (all of which happen to forward New World Order agendas) as well as in the ignorance, immorality, and intellectual torpidity among those who claim to be Muslims does not mitigate the responsibility a man has to investigate the Qur\u2019an on its merits when it reaches him, or his accountability when he turns away from warning based on the same.",74],[44,14,1,"1.

Nevertheless, there is a subtle connection between this passage and the preceding allusion to the \u201ctest\u201d with which the children of Israel were to be faced: for it is a historical fact that up to the time of the destruction of the Second Temple and their dispersion by the Roman emperor Titus, the priestly aristocracy among the Jews, known as the Sadducees, openly denied the concepts of resurrection, divine judgment and life in the hereafter, and advocated a thoroughly materialistic outlook on life.",5],[44,35,1,"1.

Muhammad Asad supplies the following note which I reproduce for interest: \u201cTubba\u2019\u201d was the title borne by a succession of powerful Himyar kings who ruled for centuries over the whole of South Arabia, and were finally overcome by the Abyssinians in the fourth century of the Christian era.

Since, however, the common denominator in all the possible meanings of the term amr - e.g., \u201ccommand\u201d, \u201cinjunction\u201d, \u201cordinance , matter [of concern]\u201d, \u201cevent\u201d, \u201caction\u201d, etc. - is the element of purpose, whether implied or explicit, we may safely assume that this is the meaning of the term in the above elliptic phrase, which obviously alludes to the purpose underlying all divine revelation and, consequently, man\u2019s faith in it. Now from the totality of the Qur\u2019anic teachings, becomes apparent that the innermost purpose of all true faith is, firstly, a realization of the existence of God and of every human being\u2019s responsibility to Him; secondly, man\u2019s attaining to a consciousness of his own dignity as a positive element - a logically necessary element - in God\u2019s plan of creation and, thus, achieving freedom from all manner of superstitions and irrational fears; and, lastly, making man aware that whatever good or evil he does is but done for the benefit, or to the detriment, of his own self (as expressed in verse 15 above).",44],[45,17,2,"2.

This is the only occurrence in the Qur\u2019an of makkah; it is a common noun which, when translated as such makes perfect sense in the context: \u0645\u0643\u0629 \u2014 from the m-k-k root \u2014 means destruction in the same way that \u0646\u0643\u0628\u0629 following the same pattern in n-k-b means disaster (I am indebted to Brother Ayman for this point); see, for example, Steingass (p. 1045) who includes to destroy as a value for the verb makka. However, even if the collocation here is claimed to denote a physical location, the city of Petra fits that description as it was located in an enclosed valley and was thus very much belly-like. The city today called Mecca fails to impress on this latter count entirely; it is no secret that many Traditionalist Muslims return from pilgrimage to Mecca confused and disappointed, finding the geography at odds with Qur\u2019anic descriptions. This nuance is something the Traditionalist is keen to hide from the reader with no access to Arabic. He typically inclines to a value here for the Arabic ba\u1e6dn (belly, womb) which obfuscates for the reader its actual meaning, preferring here values such as valley or midst.

In my opinion, however, the second of the two possible meanings (\u201cthe two that aim at meeting each other\u201d) corresponds better with the preceding verse, which speaks of what man\u2019s innermost self (nafs) - whispers within him\u201d, i.e., voices his subconscious desires. Thus, \u201cthe two that aim at meeting\u201d are, I believe, the two demands of, or, more properly, the two fundamental motive forces within man\u2019s nature: his primal, instinctive urges and desires, both sensual and non-sensual (all of them comprised in the modern psychological term \u201clibido\u201d), on the one side, and his reason, both intuitive and reflective, on the other. The \u201csitting (qa\u2019id) on the right and on the left\u201d is, to my mind, a metaphor for the conflicting nature of these dual forces which strive for predominance within every human being: hence, my rendering of qa\u2019id as \u201ccontending\u201d. This interpretation is, moreover, strongly supported by the reference, in verse 21, to man\u2019s appearing on Judgment Day with \u201cthat which drives and that which bears witness\u201d - a phrase which undoubtedly alludes to man\u2019s instinctive urges as well as his conscious reason.",22],[50,19,1,"1.

While I am neutral on Muhammad Asad\u2019s comments here, they follow with some light editing: Lit., \u201cwith that which drives (sa\u2019iq) and that which bears witness (shahid)\u201d. While the former term evidently circumscribes man\u2019s primal urges - and particularly those which drive him into unrestrained self-indulgence and, thus, into sin - the term shahd [...]alludes here to the awakening of the deeper layers of man\u2019s consciousness, leading to a sudden perception of his own moral reality - the \u201clifting of the veil\u201d referred to in the next verse - which forces him to \u201cbear witness\u201d against himself (cf. 17:14, 24:24, 36:65, 41:20).",57],[50,22,1,"1. Those who experience what are called near-death experiences report that their powers of perception are expanded beyond compare with what they have in life.",109],[50,23,1,"1. This term (Arabic: qar\u012bn) generally treats of the shay\u1e6d\u0101n (see 4:38, 4:38, 43:36, 43:38; see also 41:25, 50:27). That shay\u1e6d\u0101n treats of an adversary (against the command of God). see Article SJC. The Traditionalist typically sees this as a reference to an angel. Muhammad Asad, meanwhile, offers another perspective in his note to this verse: Lit., \u201chis intimate companion\u201d (qarinuhu). The term qarin denotes something that is \u201cconnected\u201d, \u201clinked\u201d or \u201cintimately associated\u201d with another thing (cf. 41:25 and 43:36, where qarin is rendered as \u201c[one\u2019s] other self\u201d). In the present instance - read together with verse 21 - the term apparently denotes \u201cone part\u201d of man, namely, his awakened moral consciousness.",17],[50,24,1,"1.

The Traditionalist typically sees this as a reference to a shay\u1e6d\u0101n. Muhammad Asad\u2019s thoughts at this juncture, with light editing, follow: Lit., as in verse 23, \u201chis intimate companion\u201d (qarin): but whereas there it may be taken as denoting man\u2019s moral consciousness or reason, in the present instance the \u201cspeaker\u201d is obviously its counterpart, namely, the complex of the sinner\u2019s instinctive urges and inordinate, unrestrained appetites summarized in the term sa\u2019iq (\u201cthat which drives\u201d) and often symbolized as shaytan (\u201csatan\u201d or \u201csatanic force\u201d) In this sense, the term qarin has the same connotation as in 41:25 and 43:36.",13],[50,28,1,"1.

(Cf. the same use of the term shahid in verse 21.)

This word occurs only once in the text. It can have the connotation of sleeping through the first portion of the night. Historically, people have used different sleeping patterns to that common today. Certainly, in medieval England, it was common to have two phases of sleep (first sleep and second sleep) broken by an hour for prayer or other activities, typically between two and three in the morning. Roger Ekirch, author of At Day\u2019s Close: Night in Times Past writes: [...]in \u2018The Squire\u2019s Tale\u2019 in The Canterbury Tales, Canacee slept \u201csoon after evening fell\u201d and subsequently awakened in the early morning following \u201cher first sleep\u201d; in turn, her companions, staying up much later, \u201clay asleep till it was fully prime\u201d (daylight). Elsewhere he says: Although in some descriptions a neighbor\u2019s quarrel or a barking dog woke people prematurely from their initial sleep, the vast weight of surviving evidence indicates that awakening naturally was routine not the consequence of disturbed or fitful slumber. Medical books, in fact, from the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries frequently advised sleepers, for better digestion and more tranquil repose, to lie on their right side during \u201cthe fyrste slepe\u201d and \u201cafter the fyrste slepe turne on the lefte side.\u201d And even though the French historian Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie investigated no further, his study of fourteenth-century Montaillou notes that \u201cthe hour of first sleep\u201d was a customary division of night, as was \u2018the hour halfway through the first sleep.\u201d Indeed, though not used as frequently as expressions like \u201ccandle-lighting,\u201d the \u201cdead of night\u201d, or cock-crow,\u201d the term \u201cfirst sleep\u201d remained a common temporal division until the late eighteenth-century. As described in La Demonolatrie (1595) by Nicholas Remy, \u201cComes dusk, followed by nightfall, dark night, then the moment of the first sleep and finally dead of night.\u201d Cf. 73:1-6.",10],[51,18,1,"1.

Abdullah Yusuf Ali makes some excellent points which I have extracted from his broader comment here: True charity remembers not only those in need who ask, but also those who are prevented by some reason from asking. The man of true charity seeks out the latter. There may be various reasons which prevent a man from asking for help: (1) he may be ashamed to ask, or his sense of honour may prevent him from asking; (2) he may be so engrossed in some great ideal that he may not think of asking; (3) he may even not know that he is in need, especially when we think of wealth and possessions in a spiritual sense, as including spiritual gifts and talents; (4) he may not know that you possess the things that can supply his needs; and (5) he may be a dumb and helpless creature, whether a human being or a dumb animal, or any creature within your ken or power.

Clearly, the two meanings are connected; the question is: which is meant here? Modern translations tend to use values such as enlarge or expand under the influence of popularised theories about the nature of the universe. The methodology here, however, is in cases of doubt where there exists a clear Qur\u2019anic sense, to default to that sense. On that basis, I must render as I do. Firstly, because the form IV verb occurs only twice, both times as the active participle: here and at 2:236; at 2:236 it unambiguously means to be wealthy \u2014 a value with which all agree, and the context admits of nothing else; secondly, because to achieve the value of expand and synonyms here at 51:47 requires the addition of an object, and while some translators make their own additions, such an object is absent from the text.

The Traditionalist has, naturally, a stock of stories to which he refers here, but which seem to me a distraction from the main point. What Mu\u1e25ammad personally saw, I do not know. I do not need to know; I know what matters: that it was a true encounter. What men choose to write about it after the fact is of little interest to me, and in no way changes what for me is a key point of this chapter, which is quite the reverse of what the Traditionalist claims for it. The Traditionalist says that the principal subject here is the Angel Gabriel. Frankly, an untrained reading more readily suggests that the subject is God. Since the subject at 53:10 is obviously (and by common consent) God, absent a firm textual marker, one inclines to the view that God is the subject at 53:5-9 also. For me, confirmation of the key lesson of this part of the chapter is found at 53:19-25 which presents the consideration (lit.: seeing) of false gods as a counterpoint to what precedes (i.e. mention of the one true God). Additionally, I would argue that the pan-textual evidence is against the Traditionalist\u2019s reading of an angel here, since it is God who taught the Qur\u2019an (see 55:2; cf. 53:5). Nevertheless, I have resisted the temptation to capitalise the masculine personal pronouns at 53:6-8 and 53:13 and confined my thoughts to the notes.",49],[53,4,1,"1.

My thought here is that the names of the branches of knowledge today called sciences come from Greek terms which are feminine nouns. Meanwhile, Muhammad Asad has a different view: Lit., \u201cthat name the angels with a female name\u201d - i.e., think of them as being endowed with sex and/or as being \u201cGod\u2019s daughters\u201d. As the Qur\u2019an points out in many places, the people spoken of in this context do believe in life after death, inasmuch as they express the hope that the angels and the imaginary deities which they worship will \u201cmediate\u201d between them and God, and will \u201cintercede\u201d for them. However, their belief is far too vague to make them realize that the quality of man\u2019s life in the hereafter does not depend on such outside factors but is causally, and directly, connected with the manner of his life in this world: and so the Qur\u2019an declares that their attitude is, for all practical purposes, not much different from the attitude of people who reject the idea of a hereafter altogether.",82],[53,28,1,"1.

The narrative function of 54:1 is that of the prophetic past (a device found frequently in the Qur\u2019an) whereby future events are given greater inevitability by treating them as accomplished facts; such instances are usually presented in English in the future tense. Thus, the current phrase has a fully future application. However, there is a second layer to it. In order to grasp that layer, one needs to understand several things: 1. The use of the verb here in the Qur\u2019an (Arabic: iqtaraba), (see note to 21:2). 2. That the latter portion of the Qur\u2019an forms a series of night vigils the purpose of which is to warn those who reject and to fortify those who accept (see Notepad XXI). 3. That Mu\u1e25ammad\u2019s station as a prophet and messenger meant that he was executing the mechanism of warning followed by destruction (when rejected) that runs through the Qur\u2019an (detailed in my work The God Protocol). 4. That, given point 3, Judgment was itself closing in upon the people to whom the messenger-prophet was preaching. 5. That the statement here \u2018Drawn nigh has the Hour\u2019 echoes the sense of what precedes at 53:57 \u2014 immediately following which we read that God alone can forestall its advent.",11],[54,1,2,"2. Claims are made for this verse by the Traditionalist which I do not accept. While I do not share Asad\u2019s confidence in the \u2018reports\u2019 he mentions to any degree at all, his comments here are worthy of consideration, and will be helpful in equipping the student with a broader perspective: Most of the commentators see in this verse a reference to a phenomenon said to have been witnessed by several of the Prophet\u2019s contemporaries. As described in a number of reports going back to some companions, the moon appeared one night as if split into two distinct parts. While there is no reason to doubt the subjective veracity of these reports, it is possible that what actually happened was an unusual kind of partial lunar eclipse, which produced an equally unusual optical illusion. But whatever the nature of that phenomenon, it is practically certain that the above Qur\u2019an-verse does not refer to it but, rather, to a future event: namely, to what will happen when the Last Hour approaches. (The Qur\u2019an frequently employs the past tense to denote the future, and particularly so in passages which speak of the coming of the Last Hour and of Resurrection Day; this use of the past tense is meant to stress the certainty of the happening to which the verb relates.) Thus, Raghib regards it as fully justifiable to interpret the phrase inshaqqa \u2018l-qamar (\u201cthe moon is split asunder\u201d) as bearing on the cosmic cataclysm - the end of the world as we know it - that will occur before the coming of Resurrection Day (see art. shaqq in the Mufradat). As mentioned by Zamakhshari, this interpretation has the support of some of the earlier commentators; and it is, to my mind, particularly convincing in view of the juxtaposition, in the above Qur\u2019an-verse, of the moon\u2019s \u201csplitting asunder\u201d and the approach of the Last Hour. (In this connection we must bear in mind the fact that none of the Qur\u2019anic allusions to the \u201cnearness\u201d of the Last Hour and the Day of Resurrection is based on the human concept of \u201ctime\u201d.)",58],[54,2,1,"1.

Hence, muqw denotes \u201cone who is hungry\u201d as well as \u201cone who is lost [or \u201cwho wanders\u201d] in a deserted place\u201d.

Contrary to well-funded \u2018scientific\u2019 fictions driven into the mind before the age of rational thought is reached and fortified endlessly by TV and cinema fictions, any objective investigation into this question by calm, adult minds shows that the earth is level and fixed, and that the heavens go round above it. While I do not agree fully with Muhammad Asad\u2019s comment here (he renders: [...]the coming-down in parts [of this Qur\u2019an]), I include it (with some light editing) for interest: Lit.: \u201cthe setting of the stars\u201d. The term mawqi\u2019 (of which mawaqi is the plural) denotes the \u201ctime [or \u201cplace\u201d or \u201cmanner\u201d] at which something comes down\u201d. Although many of the commentators think that the phrase mawaqi an-nujum relates to the break-up of the stars at the Last Hour, Ibn \u2018Abbas, \u2018Ikrimah and As-Suddi were definitely of the opinion, strongly supported by the subsequent verses, that this phrase refers to the step-by-step revelation or \u201ccoming-down in parts (nujum)\u201d - of the Qur\u2019an (cf. Tabari and Ibn Kathir). By \u201ccalling to witness\u201d the gradual manner of its revelation, the Qur\u2019an points implicitly to the astounding fact that it has remained free of all inconsistencies and inner contradictions (cf. 4:82) despite all the dramatic changes in the Prophet\u2019s life during the \u201cunfolding\u201d of the divine writ: and this explains, too, the subsequent parenthetic clause (verse 76).",42],[56,77,1,"1.

Muhammad Asad offers some interesting observations here: Side by side with enabling man to discriminate between right and wrong (which is the innermost purpose of all divine revelation), God has endowed him with the ability to convert to his use the natural resources of his earthly environment. An outstanding symbol of this ability is man\u2019s skill, unique among all animated beings, in making tools; and the primary material for all tool-making - and, indeed, for all human technology - is iron: the one metal which is found abundantly on earth, and which can be utilized for beneficial as well as destructive ends. The \u201cawesome power\u201d (ba\u2019s shadid) inherent in iron manifests itself not merely in the manufacture of weapons of war but also, more subtly, in man\u2019s ever-growing tendency to foster the development of an increasingly complicated technology which places the machine in the foreground of all human existence and which, by its inherent - almost irresistible - dynamism, gradually estranges man from all inner connection with nature. This process of growing mechanization, so evident in our modern life, jeopardizes the very structure of human society and, thus, contributes to a gradual dissolution of all moral and spiritual perceptions epitomised in the concept of \u201cdivine guidance\u201d. It is to warn man of this danger that the Qur\u2019an stresses - symbolically and metonymically - the potential evil (ba\u2019s) of \u201ciron\u201d if it is put to wrong use: in other words, the danger of man\u2019s allowing his technological ingenuity to run wild and thus to overwhelm his spiritual consciousness and, ultimately, to destroy all possibility of individual and social happiness.",193],[57,26,1,"1.

Qur\u2019anic usage: The expression believe in at 58:4 requires an action in order to be valid, and therefore presupposes something distinct from mere verbal or intellectual assent, or even an event in the heart \u2014 although all are certainly some part of what is meant by believe in. In order for believe in to be achievable here one must do something; perhaps the expression prove faithful to better conveys in English what is implicit in the statement. From this we can deduce that in the Qur\u2019anic worldview to believe in is not merely a matter of what claims or feels. It is that which governs how a man makes his choices in the world. With the division of church and state men have gained the impression that their religion is what they do \u2014 if they do so at all \u2014 for an hour in a church on a Sunday, or in a mosque on a Friday. This is a false impression. What a man does for an hour here and there is more properly called a hobby. It is what he does with the rest of the time which is his religion. Within the Qur\u2019anic model, works are not an add-on to \u2014 or confirmation of \u2014 \u2018belief in\u2019; they are a direct function of what belief in means.",194],[58,4,5,"5.

My own view is that the core sense of this verse is that a man\u2019s talents make room for him. I provide below, for interest, two distinct Traditionalist readings. The more adamant Traditionalist tends to see this verse primarily in terms of his religion and Caliphate-building project. Typical of this view are Hilali & Khan, whose rendering of the verse follows: O you who believe! When you are told to make room in the assemblies, (spread out and) make room. Allah will give you (ample) room (from His Mercy). And when you are told to rise up [for prayers, Jihad (holy fighting in Allah\u2019s Cause), or for any other good deed], rise up. Allah will exalt in degree those of you who believe, and those who have been granted knowledge. And Allah is Well-Acquainted with what you do. Traditionalist convert Muhammad Asad takes a less vociferous view, and his numbered notes to this verse follow his rendering of the verse itself: O YOU who have attained to faith! When you are told, \u201cMake room for one another in your collective life\u201d,1 do make room: [and in return,] God will make room for you [in His grace].2 And whenever you are told, \u201cRise up [for a good deed]\u201d, do rise up;3 [and] God will exalt by [many] degrees those of you who have attained to faith and, [above all,] such as have been vouchsafed [true] knowledge:4 for God is fully aware of all that you do. 1. Lit., \u201cin the assemblies (al-majalis)\u201d. Although it is frequently assumed that this refers to the assemblies held by the Prophet, when his followers would throng around him in their eagerness the better to hear what he had to say, or - more generally - to congregations in mosques, etc., in later times, I am (with Razi) of the opinion that the plural noun majalis is used here in a tropical or metaphorical sense, denoting the totality of men\u2019s social life. Taken in this sense, the \u201cmaking room for one another\u201d implies the mutual providing of opportunities for a decent life to all - and especially to the needy or handicapped - members of the community. 2. Commenting on this passage, Razi says: \u201cThis verse indicates that if one widens the means (abwab) of happiness and well-being of God\u2019s creatures (\u2018ibad), God will widen for him all that is good in this life and in the hereafter. Hence, no reasonable person (al-\u2019aqil) could ever restrict [the purport of] this \u2018verse to merely making room for one another in an [actual) assembly.\u201d 3. The interpretation implied in the words \u201cfor a good deed\u201d interpolated by me above is analogous to that offered by most of the classical commentators, and most explicitly by Tabari; in the words of Qatadah (ibid.), \u201cWhenever you are called upon to do a good deed, respond to this call.\u201d 4. Cf. the saying of the Prophet: \u201cThe superiority of a learned man (\u2018alim) over a [mere] worshipper (\u2018abid) is like the superiority of the moon on the night when it is full over all other stars\u201d (Ibn Hanbal, Abu Da\u2019ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa\u2019i, Ibn Majah and Darimi).",285],[58,12,1,"1.

The attentive reader will observe that the expression God and His messenger is generic; while it certainly relates to the recipient of the Qur\u2019an, it refers in places to different messengers sent at various times. As believers, we are required to follow guidance and to make no distinction among the messengers of God (2:136, 2:253, 2:285, 3:84, 4:152, 17:55, 37:181, 38:45-48).",62],[59,5,1,"1.

The central portion of 59:7 is habitually, mightily, and comically abused at the hands of the Traditionalist; his abuse of it is intended to open the floodgates to his preferred literature. It is a feint \u2014 a form of bait-and-switch \u2014 by which means he achieves an end-run around the psychological defences of the unwary or of those unprepared to do their own due diligence on the Qur\u2019an. The context at 59:7 treats of the allocation of material things exclusively \u2014 at the time the Messenger was alive. To ascribe to it any other value is, frankly, deceit. The way the Traditionalist quotes this small part of one verse out of context is analogous to claiming that the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) says there is no God. Of course, it does indeed say that (at Psalms 14:1, for example). However, the whole verse reads: The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good. The Qur\u2019an warns against those who twist the words of God (5:41). The Traditionalist\u2019s problem here (aside from his requirement to find Qur\u2019anic authority for his religion where there is none) is that he has not understood the concept of implicit punctuation. Verse 59:8 begins with For the poor \u00e9migr\u00e9s[...]. The Traditionalist translator is forced to insert words of his own composition here such as It is[...]. However, when we understand that there is no oversight or deficiency in the text, but rather that the mechanics of the syntax implicitly force us to break the narrative into blocks on the basis of our own intelligence (and that this mechanism is itself a safeguard against the very type of abuse under discussion) then we begin to appreciate the beauty and wisdom of this mechanism, and to regard it as an ally.",328],[59,7,4,"4.

While I do not follow him in my rendering, the reader should know what the Traditionalist claims in this regard. Muhammad Asad summarises the point as well as anybody: This prediction is supported by several references in the Gospel of St. John to the Parakletos (usually rendered as \u201cComforter\u201d) who was to come after Jesus. This designation is almost certainly a corruption of Periklytos (\u201cthe Much-Praised\u201d), an exact Greek translation of the Aramaic term or name Mawhamana. (It is to be borne in mind that Aramaic was the language used in Palestine at the time of, and for some centuries after, Jesus, and was thus undoubtedly the language in which the original - now lost - texts of the Gospels were composed.) In view of the phonetic closeness of Periklytos and Parakletos it is easy to understand how the translator - or, more probably, a later scribe - confused these two expressions. It is significant that both the Aramaic Mawhamana and the Greek Periklytos have the same meaning as the two names of the Last Prophet, Muhammad and Ahmad, both of which are derived from the verb hamida (\u201che praised\u201d) and the noun hamd (\u201cpraise\u201d). An even more unequivocal prediction of the advent of the Prophet Muhammad - mentioned by name, in its Arabic form - is said to be forthcoming from the so-called Gospel of St. Barnabas, which, though now regarded as apocryphal, was accepted as authentic and was read in the churches until the year 496 of the Christian era, when it was banned as \u201cheretical\u201d by a decree of Pope Gelasius. However, since the original text of that Gospel is not available (having come down to us only in an Italian translation dating from the late sixteenth century), its authenticity cannot be established with certainty. It is my opinion that the Gospel of St. Barnabas \u2014 which I have read several times \u2014 while interesting, was written within the Islamic period. It contains references and assumptions which identify it as a piece of \u2014 perhaps pious \u2014 Islamic extemporisation rather than an original scripture containing the words and deeds of \u02bf\u012as\u0101. See also 7:157 and note thereto.",228],[61,6,5,"5. Arabic: si\u1e25r \u2014 sorcery. See note to 2:102.",311],[61,7,1,"1. Arabic: al isl\u0101m. This is one of those junctures in the Qur\u2019an where the Traditionalist attempts to impress upon the ignorant and unwary the idea that the wording implies support for his religion. This word is an abstract noun and means peace or submission (to God). See 3:18-19 and notes thereto. That this does not (and cannot) imply acceptance of the Traditionalist\u2019s religion is particularly obvious given that the preceding context treats of first M\u016bs\u0101 and then of \u02bf\u012as\u0101, both of whom appealed to their respective people and neither of whom were Muslims in the sense the Traditionalist uses the word. Rather, the term indicates the submission of the will to that of another. This is clear when we compare this clause with 47:35 where the same collocation (in the active voice) is used in the purely prosaic sense of sue for peace in a war setting. Consider also 40:10 which treats of the invitation to faith (not to a specific \u2018religion\u2019); and see also 68:42-43 where the setting is the Day of Judgment. Given the typical Traditionalist treatment of the notion of al isl\u0101m in this context, this verse and the one following should make sobering reading for any Traditionalist capable of reflective thought.",93],[61,7,2,"2.

Traditionalist translators are coy about exactly who is the subject here, God or the Messenger, with both Saheeh International and Hilali & Khan opting to omit either he or He at this juncture, and rendering instead by means of the infinitive (a form which, in point of fact, does not feature in Arabic). By way of illustration of how he injects the text with his required outcomes, here is Hilali & Khan\u2019s rendering of the whole verse: He it is Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad SAW) with guidance and the religion of truth (Islamic Monotheism) to make it victorious over all (other) religions even though the Mushrikun (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah and in His Messenger Muhammed SAW) hate (it). But the subject of the clause under question can only be God, and the point is better made explicitly, which Muhammad Asad does. His rendering of the phrase reads: to the end that He make it prevail over all [false] religion, which he supports with following note: Cf. 3:19 - \u201cthe only [true] religion in the sight of God is [man\u2019s] self surrender unto Him\u201d.",86],[61,9,4,"4.

Then the point cannot be obfuscated which is that we are not to deviate from our central calling in our affections. The battles, victories, and gains are all very well \u2014 and God, indeed, promises to strengthen us against our enemies \u2014 but battles and victories are not the point; we are to keep God at the centre of our affections and our motivations.

Muhammad Asad\u2019s comments here presuppose acceptance of the Christian extension of the dominant Egypt-Palestine thesis and provide some useful additional information from that perspective: [...]I.e., some of them recognized him as a prophet - and, therefore, as no more than a created, human being - whereas others denied this truth in the course of time by regarding him as \u201cthe son of God\u201d - and, therefore, as \u201cGod incarnate\u201d - while still others rejected him and his message altogether. The fact that the earliest followers of Jesus regarded him as purely human is evident from the many theological controversies which persisted during the first three or four centuries of the Christian era. Thus, some renowned theologians, like Theodotus of Byzantium, who lived towards the end of the second century, and his followers - among them Paul of Samosata, Bishop of Antioch in the year 260 - maintained that the \u201csonship of God\u201d mentioned in the then-existing texts of the Gospels was purely symbolic, denoting no more than that Jesus was a human being exalted by God. The originally widespread teachings of Bishop Arius (280-326) centred in the concept of Jesus as a mortal man chosen by God for a specific task, and in the concept of God as absolutely One, unknowable, and separate from every created being; this doctrine, however, was ultimately condemned by the Councils of Nicaea (325) and Constantinople (381), and gradually ceased to have any influence on the Christian masses.

This word has come to mean Friday over time, but the contrived nature of that position is clear when we consider the days of the week in the Arabic language in translation: we have the first day (Sunday), the second day (Monday), the third day (Tuesday), the fourth day (Wednesday), the fifth day (Thursday), the day of assembly (Friday), and the Sabbath day (Saturday). It does not require much analysis to see what has happened. To equate Friday with the day of assembly is on a par with arguing that Monday (moon-day) is the day the moon comes out. Given the language in the passage (specifically \u2018disband\u2019 at 62:11 with its military implication, and the fact that the Jews are addressed in terms of their fear of death at 62:7-8) I must regard the assembly mentioned here as implying military muster: the call to arms to defend the community, or to fight in the way of God. One also notes that the Arabic speaks of al \u1e63al\u0101t min yawm al juma\u02bfa. This is a very odd construction if what is meant is what the Traditionalist understands by it, namely: al \u1e63al\u0101t on the day of al juma\u02bfa.

The latter half of this popular statement is found here at 63:1 in the mouths of the waverers \u2014 who are directly stated by God to be liars.

The Traditionalist\u2019s understanding is that the reference here is to God, and he capitalises here accordingly. While I am tempted to capitalise these attributes also, I have refrained for two reasons: 1. Had revelation been the agency, the words themselves would form part of the Qur\u2019an; but they are not found within it; the words \u2018and God made it known to him\u2019 can easily imply human agency since all things are ultimately attributable to God. 2. This combination of attributes (\u2018the knowing, the aware\u2019) occurs nowhere in the Qur\u2019an beyond this single instance.

And on that basis alone, my view is that the case here seems to be that certain male commentators have found distasteful the idea that women should travel \u2014 that women should be on a journey as significant as their own \u2014 and have applied a sense to this word which keeps the woman in what they have seen as her place.

While the pronoun object here is the masculine singular, it is typically rendered her in English so as not to break continuity. However, N. J. Dawood takes the masculine pronoun as a reference to the masculine noun womb (Arabic: ba\u1e6dn). This is understandable given the correlation between this verse and 21:91. The Traditionalist tends to include a note here referring to an item of clothing, which he takes to be the object, and which I assume comes from his preferred supplanting literature. Muhammad Asad furnishes a useful comment to 21:91 which I repeat here also: This allegorical expression, used here with reference to Mary\u2019s conception of Jesus, has been widely - and erroneously - interpreted as relating specifically to his birth. As a matter of fact, the Qur\u2019an uses the same expression in three other places with reference to the creation of man in general - namely in 15:29 and 38:72, \u201cwhen I have formed him... and breathed into him of My spirit\u201d; and in 32:9, \u201cand thereupon He forms [lit., \u201cformed\u201d] him fully and breathes lit., \u201cbreathed\u201d] into him of His spirit\u201d. In particular, the passage of which the last-quoted phrase is a part (i.e., 32:7-9) makes it abundantly and explicitly clear that God \u201cbreathes of His spirit\u201d into every human being. Commenting on the verse under consideration, Zamakhshari states that \u201cthe breathing of the spirit [of God] into a body signifies the endowing it with life\u201d: an explanation with which Razi concurs. As for the description of Mary as allati ahsanat farjaha; idiomatically denoting \u201cone who guarded her chastity\u201d (lit., \u201cher private parts\u201d), it is to be borne in mind that the term ihsan - lit., \u201c[one\u2019s] being fortified [against any danger or evil]\u201d - has the tropical meaning of \u201cabstinence from what is unlawful or reprehensible\u201d (Taj al-\u2019Arus), and especially from illicit sexual intercourse, and is applied to a man as well as a woman: thus, for instance, the terms muhsan and muhsanah are used elsewhere in the Qur\u2019an to describe, respectively, a man or a woman who is \u201cfortified [by marriage] against unchastity\u201d. Hence, the expression allati ahsanat farjaha, occurring in the above verse as well as in 66:12 with reference to Mary, is but meant to stress her outstanding chastity and complete abstinence, in thought as well as in deed, from anything unlawful or morally reprehensible: in other words, a rejection of the calumny (referred to in 4:156 and obliquely alluded to in 19:27-28) that the birth of Jesus was the result of an \u201cillicit union\u201d.

It has two core ranges of sense. These one might summarise as congruency, and overspreading. Most translations employ the first option, beginning from a starting point of congruency, conformity and compatibility to reach the commonest renderings of layers and one above another. These are acceptable meanings; but one cannot escape the suspicion that their popularity is driven by modern conceptions. Muhammad Asad commits to this side of the etymological line fully but without any interpretative infusion, rendering this word as: in full harmony with one another. But, as mentioned, this word has another range of applicable meanings: to overspread, to cover fully. Lane (p. 1879) supplies: what fills, or would fill the earth; extending over it in general. On this basis, the statement here is that the seven heavens overspread (the earth in its entirety). In my own translation, I have opted to use in harmony, which is acceptable, and compatible with values such as layers and one above another, but which does not assume the conclusions those values frequently engender.",37],[67,3,2,"2.

This is seen by some to refer to what the angels write. The context, in my view, points to a different conclusion. I see this oath as an anticipation of the calumny written about Mu\u1e25ammad, most prolifically by those who claim to follow him, but by others also, filled as such writing is with personal calumny and direct contradictions with the Book he was commissioned to convey. For his part, the Traditionalist has, among his stock of such stories about Mu\u1e25ammad, the assertion that the prophetic process was for him such that an objective observer would find indistinguishable from a form of possession. Naturally, such a narrative is found nowhere in the Qur\u2019an.",51],[68,4,1,"1. Arabic: khuluq. This is often translated character, nature, way. This is not incorrect, but has been used to obfuscate the broader sense by those who would pour honours upon the Messenger which the Qur\u2019an denies him. The word khuluq occurs at just one other place (26:137). There it is found in the mouths of those who disbelieve as something pertaining only to the tradition of former peoples. From this it follows that khuluq denotes an accepted code of practice, a way of doing things pertaining to a wider purview than that of mere personal morality or character \u2014 which is the value the Traditionalist ascribes to khuluq at 68:4. The case I am making is more than supported by the use of the preposition \u02bfal\u0101 here which, when used without reference to a particular verb (as here), indicates on, or upon and is used often to denote adherence to or standing upon (in the sense of basing one\u2019s assumptions upon). The sense, then, is that the Messenger is upon a \u2018tremendous tradition\u2019 \u2014 the tradition of all the messengers: the tradition of those who came with their warnings, were (typically) rejected, and whose ministries were followed by punishment from God \u2014 a pattern to which verses 68:5-6 allude. My analysis was conducted entirely without reference to Muhammad Asad, but I find it noteworthy that his conclusions comport to a significant extent with my own, and I reproduce part of his comment here for interest: The term khuluq, rendered by me as \u201cway of life\u201d, describes a person\u2019s \u201ccharacter\u201d, \u201cinnate disposition\u201d or \u201cnature\u201d in the widest sense of these concepts, as well as \u201chabitual behaviour\u201d which becomes, as it were, one\u2019s \u201csecond nature\u201d (Taj al-\u2019Arus). My identification of khuluq with \u201cway of life\u201d is based on the explanation of the above verse by Abd Allah ibn Abbas (as quoted by Tabari), stating that this term is here synonymous with din: and we must remember that one of the primary significances of the latter term is \u201ca way [or \u201cmanner\u201d] of behaviour\u201d or \u201cof acting\u201d (Qamus).",41],[68,13,1,"1. Lit.: after that.",14],[68,13,2,"2. Or bastard; outsider; ignoble. I include Muhammad Asad\u2019s note to this word for interest: The commentators give the most divergent interpretations to the term zanim, which is evidently derived from the noun zanamah, denoting either of the two wattles, or fleshy skin protuberances, hanging below the ears of a goat. Since these wattles do not seem to have any physiological function, the term zanim has come to signify \u201csomeone [or \u201csomething\u201d] not needed\u201d (Taj al-\u2019Arus): in other words, redundant or useless. It is, therefore, logical to assume that in the above context this term describes a person who is entirely useless in the social sense.",24],[68,15,1,"1. Arabic: \u0101y\u0101t.

Here that characteristic is annahu or that (it), and closely-related constructions. The verse at 72:1 identifies what was revealed to the Messenger, and other translators tend to render along the lines I have here in terms of the construction mentioned above. Thereafter, translators tend to elide this construction where it reappears. I can understand that because where this feature appears elsewhere in the broader text of the Qur\u2019an it is often redundant in English. So on first blush it makes sense to elide it in the remainder of the s\u016brah also. But it occurs in the present s\u016brah with such frequency that I was compelled to consider this feature as significant in some way. My conclusion is that it appears so repeatedly in the chapter for two reasons. Firstly, the subject matter itself treats of al jinn, whom we understand to be representative of the dominant men who sit atop any society \u2014 including ours \u2014 and rule. In our broader discussion of that topic (see Article SJC), we identify a correlation between the powers wielded by ruling elites and the effective use of esoteric or occult powers by those elites. Thus, this repeated feature emphasises the fact of this s\u016brah\u2019s revelation to the Messenger, effectively linking all sentences which contain the feature with the opening statement: Say thou: it is revealed to me, that[...]. Moreover, the recurrent accent upon the word that, while easily (and, again, correctly) elided in other circumstances, serves here not only to put the reader in mind of this s\u016brah as something revealed to Mu\u1e25ammad, but juxtaposes that fact with the words of al jinn who describe historical attempts to force access to the heavenly realms to obtain information, and that such attempts are now all but futile. Thus, this format itself makes plain that the revelation given to Mu\u1e25ammad is superior to whatever the schemes of al jinn might be. Secondly, this same mechanism sets in place an emphasis on the revealed nature of verse 72:19 \u2014 which falls outside that segment which comprises the words of al jinn \u2014 effectively pulling it back into a focus with the same emphasis on revelation as the statements of al jinn. Finally, the same mechanism serves a different but related function at 72:27. Without the, perhaps, pedantic emphasis which results from my rendering of this s\u016brah, these important points would be lost.",38],[72,1,3,"3. Arabic: nafar: men (as a collective); band, party, troop. This word is used in the opening verse of both segments which deal most extensively with al jinn in the Qur\u2019an: 46:29-31 and 72:1-14 . The construction has a partitive emphasis: it is \u2018a band of the domini\u2019 (i.e. some portion of the total number of domini), not all members of that group. This nuance will be of increasing interest as we progress through the present s\u016brah.",46],[72,1,4,"4. Arabic: al jinn. See Article SJC.",61],[72,1,5,"5.

Read here as further revelation given to the Messenger. See note to 72:1.",10],[72,4,2,"2. Generally thought by those who hold to the Traditionalist view of this chapter to refer to Ibl\u012bs. Like me, Muhammad Asad does not accept uncritically the view that al jinn are non-human entities \u2014 at least, he does not do so at this point. Asad, himself a Jew (born Leopold Weiss), supplies a comment which I include for interest: If we accept the supposition that the beings spoken of here were Jewish strangers, the \u201coutrageous things\u201d (shatat) which they mention would appear to be an allusion to the deep-set belief of the Jews that they were \u201cGod\u2019s chosen people\u201d - a belief which the Qur\u2019an consistently rejects, and of which the new converts now divested themselves. The reference could also be to the foolish in general \u2014 for example, by analogy with the construction most moderate of them (i.e. among them) at 68:28 \u2014 or to the creators of lies about God, such as the inventors of the Talmud, or Saul of Tarsus. However, my view is that since it is al jinn who are speaking \u2014 whom I identify as representative of the dominant men or ruling elites of the time \u2014 I think it most likely that they are referring to one of their own on that basis. Accordingly, I think the reference most likely to indicate Emperor Constantine who, it will be remembered, convened and presided over the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE. The result of this Council, at least according to Wikipedia as of January 2021, was that: The Council declared that the Son was true God, coeternal with the Father and begotten from His same substance, arguing that such a doctrine best codified the Scriptural presentation of the Son as well as traditional Christian belief about him handed down from the Apostles. This belief was expressed by the bishops in the Creed of Nicaea, which would form the basis of what has since been known as the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed. Emperor Constantine undoubtedly meets our criteria for al jinn, and so while the speakers in the s\u016brah seem most likely to have been Jews, as per Muhammad Asad\u2019s comment, their defining characteristic within the Qur\u2019anic framework is not here Jewishness, but membership of a ruling caste. And on that basis, the speakers would regard Emperor Constantine as one of their own. This understanding comports both with my view of al jinn as representatives of a dominant minority (the Jewish aspect of which is identified by Asad), and with the refutation of common Christian errors at 72:3. For a fuller discussion of al jinn see Article SJC.",30],[72,4,3,"3. Arabic: sha\u1e6da\u1e6d. See Notepad XI.xi.",59],[72,5,1,"1. Read here as further revelation given to the Messenger.

See Article SJC.",59],[72,5,5,"5. The implication is clearly that the speakers were wrong in their assumption. If we grant that the reference at 72:4 is to Emperor Constantine as I assert, the present verse makes sense. Constantine (as a member of the ruling elite, or domini) presided over a gathering at the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE of around 300 bishops, men whose political position at that time in Church history was unambiguously that of servi. See note to 72:4 and Article SJC.",93],[72,6,1,"1. Read here as further revelation given to the Messenger. See note to 72:1.",10],[72,6,2,"2. Arabic: al ins. See Article SJC.",32],[72,6,3,"3. I.e. aid, assistance.",51],[72,6,4,"4. The issue of how to understand the word min (Arabic: \u0645\u0650\u0646) in this context is a thorny one. The fact is that min forms a standard part of the construction in which the verb which precedes it here occurs, and does so in combination with its complement particle (Arabic: bi / \u0628\u0650). Thus, a construction familiar to most Muslims is: I seek protection with (Arabic: bi / \u0628\u0650) God from (Arabic: min / \u0645\u0650\u0646) \u2014 i.e. against \u2014 the accursed Satan. We find this construction unambiguously used at 19:18, 23:97, 40:27, 113:1-2, 114:1-4. The remaining instances of the form I of this verb (2:67, 11:47, 23:98, 44:20) use lest or that (Arabic: an / \u0627\u0646), and we can disregard those here. The question is whether one is to regard 72:6 as divergent from those structures with identical components at 19:18, 23:97, 40:27, 113:1-2, 114:1-4, and if so, on what basis. I will present in my own wording the two possible alignments, then give other translators\u2019 renderings with my comments, before presenting my conclusions. If we are to read the first clause of the present verse in alignment with its fellows in min, then we must understand it as: Men among the servi sought protection with men against the domini. Here the import is that men among the servi sought protection with others like themselves against the domini. This reading, using my own terminology, is consistent with all other instances which employ the same grammatical components. However, the divergent reading (i.e. one which, though possible to Arabic is anomalous to 19:18, 23:97, 40:27, 113:1-2, 114:1-4) is: Men among the servi sought protection with men among the domini. Here the import is that men of one kind sought refuge with men of another kind and the complement is left unfulfilled. We will now consider some translators. Here we are interested in the constructions used, not translators\u2019 understanding of key terminology. A. J. Arberry has: But there were certain men of mankind who would take refuge with certain men of the jinn; Hilali & Khan, keen to avoid textual evidence pointing to humans in the second case, have: \u2018And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the masculine among the jinns; Asad has: Yet [it has always happened] that certain kinds of humans would seek refuge with certain kinds of [such] invisible forces; lastly, Saheeh International has: And there were men from mankind who sought refuge in men from the jinn. We see that the first three translators favour what I am calling the divergent reading, while Saheeh International fudges the issue by using the ambiguous from, which can mean both from among and against. The problem, in my view, is less one of grammar than one of exegesis. The Traditionalist does not possess an understanding of each of the types of human and non-human entities discussed in Article SJC which is consistent in all places in the Qur\u2019an (he derives it from extraneous sources), so it is natural that he struggles in his exegesis here. We have been able to present a textually consistent identification of the key types, and that has assisted us in presenting an exegesis of the verses of this s\u016brah to this point, one which comports both with that identification and with the text on the page. The question is whether we can continue in that vein here while applying Occam\u2019s razor, i.e. the principle that the option requiring the smallest number of assumptions is probably the correct one. In our case, provided our exegesis is not unduly disrupted, it requires less assumptions \u2014 given that 72:6 contains the same grammatical components as 19:18, 23:97, 40:27, 113:1-2, 114:1-4 \u2014 to accept that 72:6 comports with its fellows and that the meaning of the troublesome min in this verse is what it is in all other comparable cases: from in the sense of against. This results in a full verse in: Men among the servi sought protection with men against the domini, so they increased them in baseness. Understood thus, we find a ready fit in the Servile Wars, three periods of slave uprisings in Rome (135\u2212132 BC, 104\u2212100 BC, 73\u221271 BC) which were brutally put down by the Romans, resulting in the wholesale crucifixion, torture, and death by other horrific means of the rebellious slave armies. While I cannot prove definitively that this is the reference, it fits both with the identifications I have provided and with historical reality, and aligns easily with a reading of the grammatical components found in the verse which is consistent across all comparable instances. In order to avoid an ambiguity of the type found in the Saheeh International translation I have rendered min in this case against.",69],[72,6,5,"5. Arabic: al jinn. See Article SJC.",82],[72,6,6,"6. I.e. the domini increased those among the servi in baseness. See note to 72:6 above. Arabic: rahaq. The Arabic senses include: lowness, vileness, meanness; weakness (Lane, p. 1777).",120],[72,7,1,"1. Read here as further revelation given to the Messenger. See note to 72:1.",10],[72,7,2,"2. I take the speakers here to have in view the domini in the preceding verse. Seen in this light, the implication is that the rulers of the time in question dismissed the idea of God raising up any messenger or prophet (see also other notes to this verse). Interestingly, the leader of the first slave uprising mentioned in the note above, Eunus, rose to prominence among the slaves through his claim to be both prophet and a wonder-worker. Clearly, the Roman elites did not see subscribe to Eunus\u2019 assertions. See notes to 72:6 and 72:7.",17],[72,7,3,"3. I.e. the broader group of al jinn which the speakers are addressing. I take this broader group to comprise non-Jewish elites. See note to 72:7 below.",34],[72,7,4,"4. We need to address the question of what the verb ba\u02bfatha means here. It is used in two main senses in the Qur\u2019an: to raise up (i.e. a messenger or prophet) and to raise up (i.e. after death). Among the translators I frequently review, the Traditionalists Hilali & Khan, Saheeh International, and Muhammad Asad all render after the first view, whereas the non-Traditionalist N. J. Dawood renders after the second with: that God could never resurrect the dead; non-Traditionalist A. J. Arberry is ambiguous: that God would never raise up anyone. I can only assume that the first three translators were primed to incline to their view by the usual sources, whereas the non-Traditionalists remained relatively ignorant of those sources and simply followed the Arabic on the page to the best of their abilities. The Qur\u2019an contains 52 instances of the form I of this verb (2:56, 2:129, 2:213, 2:246, 2:247, 2:259, 3:164, 4:35, 5:12, 5:31, 6:36, 6:60, 6:65, 7:14, 7:103, 7:167, 10:74, 10:75, 15:36, 16:21, 16:36, 16:38, 16:84, 16:89, 17:5, 17:15, 17:79, 17:94, 18:12, 18:19, 18:19, 19:15, 19:33, 22:7, 23:16, 23:100, 25:41, 25:51, 26:36, 26:87, 27:65, 28:59, 36:52, 37:144, 38:79, 40:34, 58:6, 58:18, 62:2, 64:7, 64:7, 72:7), and both usages are frequent among them. We need a concrete criterion by which to align the present case with one of these two meanings. We find that the construction here at 72:7 of an active verb in the negative (Arabic: lan / \u0644\u064e\u0646) is found at one other place only (40:34). There the text expressly mentions \u2018a messenger\u2019. On that basis, we can concur with the Traditionalist reading: the import here is of raising up a messenger. This leaves us with the question of the broader meaning. Muhammad Asad notes here: Thus Tabari (on the authority of Al-Kalbi) and Ibn Kathir [states that] the overwhelming majority of the Jews were convinced that no prophet would be raised after those who were explicitly mentioned in the Old Testament: hence their rejection of Jesus and, of course, Muhammad, and their \u201creaching out towards heaven\u201d (see next verse) in order to obtain a direct insight into God\u2019s plan of creation. While I agree in general terms with Asad here, there exists a broader aspect to the present case. I would agree more readily and fully with him if the text read \u2018we thought\u2019 rather than \u2018you thought\u2019 in this verse. There are, of course, cases in the Qur\u2019an where you is used where we is clearly the import (dialogue among the companions of the cave at 18:19 comes readily to mind), but in addition to the fact that we and us are routinely and consistently used by the speakers in this segment of this s\u016brah outside the present instance (see 72:1, 72:2, 72:3, 72:4, 72:5, 72:8, 72:9, 72:10, 72:11, 72:12, 72:13, 72:14) we must not disregard the fact that the speakers here are identified in both segments which treat most expansively of al jinn in the Qur\u2019an (72:1-14 and 46:29-31) as some portion of a greater number (see 72:1, 46:29). Thus, I am of the view that the change in personal pronoun here at 72:7 to you indicates a shift in addressee beyond that of the core group of speakers \u2014 or one which at the least embraces a group broader than the core group indicated by the peppering of first-person plural pronouns. On that basis, I believe that the speakers here are addressing, or at least indicating, the full complement of al jinn, perhaps including the speaking Jewish element also, but extending beyond it to include the non-Jewish elements. When we consider the remaining segment in which we can derive details for al jinn (46:29-31) we find that \u2018they turned back to their people, warning\u2019 (46:29), and that a speaker among them twice uses the warning phrase which is so central to our work in The God Protocol, namely, O our people. Thus, given the available Qur\u2019anic evidence, the case seems strongest that the shift to you at 72:7 implies a cut to the scene where the speakers appeal to their own people at 46:30-31 and, in my view, verses 72:8-15 continue in the same vein. Supposing this is correct, who are their people? Other Jews? I think not. At the level of the apex of temporal power, certainly in our own day, racial and other affiliations mean little. And in any case, a call to one\u2019s own people presupposes a connection of the basis of the stated defining characteristic, and the stated defining characteristic in either of the contexts listed is not Jewishness, but temporal dominance. Thus, given a group of Jewish dominant rulers as the subject of this part of the s\u016brah, an appeal to their people \u2014 especially given my reading of 72:4-6 \u2014 presupposes other dominant rulers, not other Jews. Supposing we are right, what does this mean? It means that here al jinn \u2014 either including the Jewish element or without it \u2014 was of the view that God would never raise up a messenger. And if our understanding of the Roman component in verses 72:4-6 is correct, this produces a tension with the (false) prophet and would-be freer of slaves from tyranny Eunus (see notes to said verses above). The implication here, of course, is that those addressed are wrong in their assumption: God was to raise up someone.",83],[72,8,1,"1. Read here as further revelation given to the Messenger. See note to 72:1.",10],[72,8,2,"2. In my analysis, 72:8-15 treats of the appeal of al jinn to their own people (see note to 72:7 above). Mu\u1e25ammad Asad (whose own process of investigation was not much dissimilar to mine on this point) feels that in the first instance this refers to the Jewish people, but also humanity at large and: [...]may be understood as alluding not only, metaphorically, to the arrogant Jewish belief in their being \u201cGod\u2019s chosen people\u201d, but also, more factually, to their old inclination to, and practice of, astrology as a means to foretell the future. Apart from this - and in a more general sense - their \u201creaching out towards heaven\u201d may be a metaphorical description of a state of mind which causes man to regard himself as \u201cself-sufficient\u201d and to delude himself into thinking that he is bound to achieve mastery over his own fate. My own view is that the reference is to the broader ruling elite \u2014 both Jewish and non-Jewish \u2014 and references their application of dark arts by which occult means they fortify their power and advance their agenda (see Article SJC).",15],[72,8,3,"3. Arabic: lamasa. This form I verb occurs four times in the Qur\u2019an. In the remaining cases (4:43, 5:6, 6:7) it treats of physical touching of various kinds in a direct sense, despite efforts by some translators to obfuscate that plain nuance here. Given that al jinn are dominant human beings we can understand the phrasing of the present verse to indicate the offices of satans in their service (see note below).",24],[72,8,4,"4. The association in this portion is clearly with the satans (Arabic: al shay\u0101\u1e6d\u012bn); see also in this connection 15:16-18, 37:6-10, 67:5 as well as 26:210-212, 81:25. It is my view that both houses of the ruling elite \u2014 Jewish and non-Jewish \u2014 utilise demonic forces.

This indicates a strict limitation placed by God upon the powers of the ruling elite and their access to the heavenly realms.

It is my view that the dominant minority maintains power in large part by means of demonic forces (see Article SJC). These forces mean that elites have known for hundreds of years that escape either into the earth or into the heavens is impossible. This sets in some relief the claims made by modern scientists and government agencies which specialise in the popular forms of cosmology and cosmogony which NASA typifies.

I take this to mean that when the ruling elite of the time in question heard the guidance given to Mu\u1e25ammad, they believed in it. This fits with my broader thesis which is that a) the inhabitants of Mu\u1e25ammad\u2019s place of origin rejected his message and \u2014 in keeping with the Qur\u2019anic narrative \u2014 were destroyed, and that b) since Mu\u1e25ammad was the messenger for all mankind, the acceptance of his message by the ruling elites of that time explains both the rapid spread of the Islamic empire and the fact that God did not destroy the entire world at that time.",61],[72,13,5,"5.

The point is made that the same dominant group contains evil men also. It remains to be seen which category best typifies the elites of today in the face of a call to guidance which follows the Qur\u2019anic protocols, although I suspect it is the latter. See my work The God Protocol.",74],[72,15,1,"1. Most classical commentators close the speech of al jinn at this point, a view which seems to me also to be correct.",57],[72,17,1,"1.

See Notepad VII.i.",25],[72,19,1,"1. Read here as further revelation given to the Messenger. See note to 72:1.",10],[72,19,2,"2. The reappearance here of the grammatical feature we identified in the note to 72:1 indicates to me that the subject of this clause is again al jinn. Some Traditionalists understand the verse along the same lines, although without sharing my identification of al jinn (for which see Article SJC). Given my analysis of the pivot in personal pronoun from we to you (see note to 72:7 above), 72:8-15 treats of the appeal of al jinn to their own people, and I see the return to the subject of al jinn here as a continuation of that analysis: a Jewish portion of the ruling elites of that time addressing their peers, which is primarily treated at 46:29-31. At 46:29 we read that \u2018they turned back to their people, warning.\u2019 This is followed by two O my / our people statements (46:30-31), which format is crucial to the Qur\u2019anic protocol of warning (see my work The God Protocol). The second of these reads: \u2018O our people: respond to the caller to God[...].\u2019 I believe it is the speaker in this instance which is referenced to at 72:19 as \u2018the servant of God\u2019, and that \u2018they\u2019 are al jinn of non-Jewish types (as discussed in notes above to this s\u016brah). Others are of the view (I assume derived from extraneous sources) that the reference is to pagan Arabs. Muhammad Asad covers that base while entertaining other possibilities. While I disagree with this analysis, I include it for interest: Lit, \u201cwould almost be upon him in crowds (libad, sing. libdah )\u201d - i.e., with a view to \u201cextinguishing God\u2019s [guiding] light\u201d (Tabari, evidently alluding to 9:32). Most of the commentators assume that the above verse refers to the Prophet Muhammad and the hostility shown to him by his pagan contemporaries. While this may have been so in the first instance, it is obvious that the passage has a general import as well, alluding to the hostility shown by the majority of people, at all times and in all societies, to a minority or an individual who stands up for a self-evident - but unpopular - moral truth.",66],[72,19,3,"3. I.e. the dominant men to whom this group of al jinn were calling as discussed in the notes to this s\u016brah above flocked to the side of their messenger (see note to this verse above) in such numbers that he was hemmed in. As a result of their acceptance, the world at this time was not destroyed (see particularly note to 72:14), and there ensued a rapid capitulation of huge territories to Muslim rule.",106],[72,20,1,"1. See note to Arabic root: sh-r-k at 6:78 and Notepad VI.",63],[72,20,2,"2. This was the extent of the Messenger\u2019s \u2018religion\u2019.

The argument is compact, but the implication is that Mu\u1e25ammad is a messenger of the type mentioned as evinced by both the final instance in this s\u016brah of the mechanism which emphasises revelation which we identified at 72:1 and have noted throughout, combined with a disclosure from the Unseen in what remains of the s\u016brah.

When applied to the recitation of a text, it signifies a calm, measured utterance with thoughtful consideration of the meaning to be brought out.

It is worth mentioning that this verse is rendered across a range of assumptions resulting in a wide degree of divergence. At one end of the spectrum, non-sectarian A. J.

A number of chapters make use of what one might call defining mechanisms (i.e. particular words or word combinations which feature conspicuously in a given chapter). In this case, the defining mechanism or characteristic is kall\u0101. It occurs four times in a staccato-like sequence throughout the chapter (thus drawing attention to itself), occurring twice at the very end of the chapter, after which we are told that it is a reminder (a formula which repeats at 80:11). My investigations show kall\u0101 to have a secondary function as a marker (or reminder) by means of which the attentive reader is directed to all other instances where kall\u0101 occurs \u2014 and that all these instances complement each other and are beneficial when read together. The central point of the set is here at 74:16 since this provides the most extensive treatment of the archetype with which the entire set deals, and does so within the dominant topic of the chapter. Thus, the student of the Qur\u2019an finds he is given a single and extensive argument which comprehensively treats of one of his dominant concerns when he draws the text together by means of these easily identified coordinates. The complete set is found at 19:79, 19:82, 23:100, 34:27, 70:15, 70:39, 74:16, 74:32, 74:53, 74:54, 75:11, 75:20, 75:26, 78:4, 78:5, 80:11, 80:23, 82:9, 83:7, 83:14, 83:15, 83:18, 89:17, 89:21, 96:6, 96:15, 96:19, 102:3, 102:4, 102:5, 104:4.

Rendered often the flesh or the skins, I retain my value for bashar here as throughout: mortal or mortal man. Muhammad Asad and N. J. Dawood render similarly here. Asad comments: Most of the commentators interpret the above elliptic phrase in the sense of \u201cchanging the appearance of man\u201d or \u201cscorching the skin of man\u201d. The rendering adopted by me, on the other hand, is based on the primary significance of the verb laha - \u201cit appeared\u201d, \u201cit shone forth\u201d or \u201cit became visible\u201d. Hence, the primary meaning of the intensive participial noun lawwah is \u201cthat which makes [something] visible\u201d. In the above context, it relates to the sinner\u2019s belated cognition of the truth, as well as to his distressing insight into his own nature, his past failings and deliberate wrongdoings, and the realization of his own responsibility for the suffering that is now in store for him: a state neither of life nor of death. (cf. 87:12-13).",21],[74,30,1,"1. See notes to Guardians of the Fire below; in a literal sense, since 19 instances of this key phrase are \u2018over it\u2019\u2014 i.e. over the word Saqar here \u2014 and the instance of a\u1e63\u1e25\u0101b al n\u0101r which follows is the last in the text.",7],[74,30,2,"2. Typically understood \u2014 not without justification given the context \u2014 to be the number of those entrusted with the management of Saqar. I offer an alternative analysis (for which, see notes immediately above and below). Additionally, much is made by some of the number nineteen based on the work of Rashad Khalifa about whose mathematical computations (and later developments based thereon) there is plenty of information online. I am not a mathematician, so I cannot pronounce on the correctness or otherwise of his and other people\u2019s results, but it does seem like fishing for numbers to me. I can\u2019t help but find those thus enthused somewhat tedious given that they expend vast amounts of (what seems to me, anyway) autistic energy trying to prove something I already know: that the Qur\u2019an is preserved and complete. I regard the Qur\u2019an as a book of guidance, something one is supposed to do something with. My objective is to apply what I call the God protocol in order to allow \u2018the punishments of God to become binding\u2019, as a last-ditch checkmate against the New World Order\u2019s drive towards all-out and permanent tyranny. On this backdrop, the fact that certain ways of adding (occasionally arbitrary) features of the Qur\u2019an result in the number nineteen is not something I can feel strongly about.",22],[74,31,1,"1. This expression, which I render outside the present instance the companions of the Fire (Arabic: a\u1e63\u1e25\u0101b al n\u0101r), occurs a total of 20 times (2:39, 2:81, 2:217, 2:257, 2:275, 3:116, 5:29, 7:36, 7:44, 7:47, 7:50, 10:27, 13:5, 39:8, 40:6, 40:43, 58:17, 59:20, 64:10, 74:31) and in all cases outside the one under discussion at 74:31 unquestionably references those who are to suffer in Hell (see also note to 74:30 above). In the absence of explicit evidence to the contrary, a reasonable man must assume that what is meant in each of the remaining 19 instances is what is meant here also. However, we do have explicit evidence in the words \u2018Over it are nineteen\u2019. I take this as recognition of the distinction between the meaning of a\u1e63\u1e25\u0101b al n\u0101r in those cases and its meaning here; thus, the fact that there are nineteen cases different to the present one is allowed for by the text. This provides also a reasonable answer to what is referenced by the number nineteen here (which itself has served as the catalyst for so much generative and speculative output of a mathematical nature beginning with Rashad Khalifa), namely: all other cases of a\u1e63\u1e25\u0101b al n\u0101r. Thus understood, the number nineteen found at 74:30 merely indicates the number of the remaining cases a\u1e63\u1e25\u0101b al n\u0101r is found meaning something other than what it means here, which fact also provides a parity bit supportive of the Qur\u2019an\u2019s claim to be complete and preserved.",42],[74,31,2,"2. I take their to refer not only to men in general, but in the first instance to the complacent rejecters discussed in the notes at 74:16, since an archetype of this category has occupied the majority of the narrative hitherto and is identified by name in this clause. A careful reading indicates that the force of their number extends to the additional categories of person which follow. Unlike the Khalifa interpretation (which considers that their relates a number of angels in the previous verse and proceeds to make much hay on that basis), my attention is on the broader narrative, and my instinct is to corroborate or reject values on that basis. In recognition of the distinction made here between a\u1e63\u1e25\u0101b al n\u0101r in all nineteen other cases and the one at hand \u2014 and given that other verses clearly reference angels in similar scenarios \u2014 I render this collocation here Guardians of the Fire which general line is taken by most other translators here.",74],[74,31,3,"3. The Arabic \u02bfidda is used both to denote a cardinal number and a number of days (count of time) throughout and so it is understandable that one might take it in the first sense, coming so close to mention of a cardinal number. However, if we regard the chapter as a whole, the broader narrative treats of human beings (and not angels which is what both the Traditionalist and Rashad Khalifa claim is being referenced in this clause) and therefore the stronger case is that the reference here is either to the number of human beings or to the number of days they live. Given what follows, the second of these two options is the one convincing to me. We each have a number of days to live, the core point of which is that we should decide for or against God. However, since we do not know how long we shall live, this fact allows those who reject to feel no great urgency about their heedlessness towards God \u2014 which serves as the cause of their denial. That same span of time allows those men who heed God\u2019s warning to respond in their respective ways also. Cf. 19:84-94.",82],[74,31,4,"4. Arabic: fitnah. See note to 2:102.",109],[74,31,5,"5.

The conventional rendering of jimalat (also spelt jimalat and jimalah) as \u201ccamels\u201d, adopted by many commentators and, until now, by all translators of the Qur\u2019an, must be rejected as grossly anomalous; see[...] the second part of 7:40 - \u201cthey shall not enter paradise any more than a twisted rope can pass through a needle\u2019s eye\u201d. In the above verse, too, the plural noun jimalah (or jimalat) signifies \u201ctwisted ropes\u201d or \u201cgiant ropes\u201d - a connotation that has been forcefully stressed by Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Sa\u2019id ibn Jubayr and others (cf. Tabari, Baghawi, Razi, Ibn Kathir; also Bukhari, Kitab at-Tafsir). Moreover, our observation of the trajectory of shooting stars fully justifies the rendering \u201cgiant fiery ropes\u201d. Similarly, my rendering of qasr, in this context, as \u201c[burning] logs\u201d - instead of the conventional (and utterly meaningless) \u201ccastles\u201d, \u201cpalaces\u201d, etc. - goes back to all of the above-mentioned authorities.",24],[77,41,1,"1.

The first three verses can be read together as a single question, in which case the implication is that those described are, in fact, not asking each other about the \u2018tremendous report\u2019 (due to indifference). This is how I personally understand this segment. But this is not the standard understanding, and I have refrained from imposing my view upon the translation, confining my dissent to the notes. Muhammad Asad, who reads the segment as per its common parsing (and as I present it in the translation) supplies a comment which I reproduce for interest: The question which preoccupies man above all others - the question as to whether there is life after death - has been variously answered throughout the ages. It is, of course, impossible to describe the innumerable variations of those answers; nevertheless, a few main lines of thought are clearly discernible, and their mention may be useful for a better understanding of the Qur\u2019anic treatment of this problem. Some people - probably a minority - seem to be convinced that bodily death amounts to total and irreversible extinction, and that, therefore, all talk about a hereafter but an outcome of wishful thinking. Others are of the opinion that after individual death the human \u201clife-essence\u201d returns to the supposed source of its origin - conceived as the \u201cuniversal soul\u201d - and merges with it entirely. Some believe in a successive transmigration of the individual soul, at the moment of death, into another body, human or animal, but without a continuation of individual consciousness. Others, again, think that only the soul, and not the entire human \u201cpersonality\u201d, continues to live after death - that is, in a purely spiritual, disembodied form. And, lastly, some believe in an undiminished survival of the individual personality and consciousness, and regard death and resurrection as the twin stages of a positive act of re-creation of the entire human personality, in whatever form this may necessarily involve: and this is the Qur\u2019anic view of the life to come.",24],[78,4,1,"1.

The Qur\u2019an is clear that the mountains are set firmly, they do not move, and they act as ballast, preventing the earth from shaking (cf. 15:19, 21:31, 79:32).

Some modern-leaning Muslim apologists attempt to square Qur\u2019anic statements with what \u2018Science\u2019 currently claims, but their arguments require the Qur\u2019an to mean something other than what it says.",28],[78,8,1,"1.

Muhammad Asad comments: According to Zamakhshari, the term ma\u2019ash (\u201cthat whereby one lives\u201d) is here synonymous with \u201clife\u201d. In the polarity of sleep (or \u201cdeath\u201d) and wakefulness (or \u201clife\u201d) we see the allusion to bodily death and subsequent resurrection already touched upon in 6:60.

I am including Muhammad Asad\u2019s comment at this verse because I respect his mind and considerable academic and contemplative talents. While I am temperamentally inclined to agree with him on this point, in the event I cannot. The reading I have followed (which is the commonest one \u2014 from which Asad explains his divergence), is not only in full agreement with the best lexicons (which, of course, do not take precedence over the Qur\u2019an\u2019s own definitions, nor are to be trusted blindly) but is also confirmed by my full analysis of this point (see Notepad XIX). I would add that while the Qur\u2019an directs itself principally to men as head of tribes and families, while women and men have different essential functions, they are of equal value and their efforts are equally rewarded \u2014 a point which the Qur\u2019an makes clearly. That being the case, when dealing with such metaphorical and highly symbolic parts of the text as this, one naturally extrapolates equivalent pleasures and rewards for women. I make this point not because I am infected with the current social viruses called political correctness and feminism, but because it is objectively the case. As a translator and interpreter and believer, I bear a responsibility for the words as they appear on the page, and it is with cognisance of that responsibility that I have both rendered as I have in this instance and felt moved to include the relevant part of Muhammad Asad\u2019s comment for the edification and broader perspective of the interested reader: [...]it is to be remembered that the term ka\u2019b - from which the participle ka\u2019ib is derived - has many meanings, and that one of these meanings is \u201cprominence\u201d, \u201ceminence\u201d or \u201cglory\u201d (Lisan al-Arab); thus, the verb ka\u2019ba, when applied to a person, signifies \u201che made [another person] prominent\u201d, \u201cglorious\u201d or \u201csplendid\u201d (ibid.) Based on this tropical meaning of both the verb ka\u2019ba and the noun ka\u2019b, the participle ka\u2019ib has often been used, in popular parlance, to denote \u201ca girl whose breasts are becoming prominent\u201d or \u201care budding\u201d hence, many commentators see in it an allusion to some sort of youthful \u201cfemale companions\u2019 who would entertain the (presumably male) inmates of paradise. But quite apart from the fact that all Quranic allegories of the joys of paradise invariably apply to men and women alike, this interpretation of kawa\u2019ib overlooks the purely derivative origin of the above popular usage - which is based on the tropical connotation of \u201cprominence\u201d inherent in the noun ka\u2019b - and substitutes for this obvious tropism the literal meaning of something that is physically prominent: and this, in my opinion, is utterly unjustified. If we bear in mind that the Quranic descriptions of the blessings of paradise are always allegorical, we realize that in the above context the term kawa\u2019ib can have no other meaning than \u201cglorious [or \u201csplendid\u201d] beings\u201d, without any definition of sex; and that, in combination with the term atrab, it denotes, \u201csplendid companions well matched\u201d - thus alluding to the relations of the blest with one another, and stressing the absolute mutual compatibility and equal dignity of all of them[...].",48],[78,35,1,"1.

Creative interpretations exist about what verses 79:1-5 refer to, none of them conclusive. I have abstained from interpretation and defaulted to those meanings of the words established elsewhere in the text or to acceptable lexical values, and list common renderings to illustrate the range of possible views. There follow five translations of the present verse: N. J. Dawood: By those who snatch away men\u2019s souls; A. J. Arberry: By those that pluck out vehemently; Saheeh International: By those [angels] who extract with violence (the translators note: i.e., those who tear out the souls of those destined for Hell); Muhammad Asad: Consider those [stars] that rise only to set; Hilali & Khan: By those (angels) who pull out (the souls of the disbelievers and the wicked) with great violence. The fact is that gharq occurs also at 10:90 and objectively means there drowning, and the form IV verb aghraqa consistently means to drown (verb: 2:50, 7:64, 7:136, 8:54, 10:73, 17:69, 17:103, 18:71, 21:77, 25:37, 26:66, 26:120, 29:40, 36:43, 37:82, 43:55, 71:25; passive participle: 11:37, 11:43, 23:27, 44:24). Clearly, drowning is a violent event, but to elide the core sense entirely is to deprive the reader of what is plain in the Arabic, so I have rendered literally and supplied additional information in the notes. Muhammad Asad\u2019s thoughts here are characteristically mystical and scholarly, and are supplied for interest: The early commentators differ widely in their explanations of verses 1-5 of this surah. The most popular interpretation is based on the view that the descriptive participles an-nazi\u2019at, an-nashitat, as-sabihat, as-sabiqat and al-mudabbirat refer to angels and their activities with regard to the souls of the dying: an interpretation categorically rejected by Abu Muslim al-Isfahani, who - as mentioned by Razi - points out that the angels are never referred to in the Qur\u2019an in the female gender, as is the case in the above five participles, and that the present passage cannot be an exception. Almost equally unconvincing - because somewhat laboured - are the explanations which link those five participles to the souls of the dying, or to warriors engaged in holy war, or to war-mounts, and so forth. The clearest and simplest interpretation is that advanced by Qatadah (as quoted by Tabari and Baghawi) and Al-Hasan al-Basri (quoted by Baghawi and Razi), who maintain that what is meant in this passage are the stars - including the sun and the moon - and their movements in space: and this interpretation is fully in tune with many other passages in the Qur\u2019an in which the harmony of those celestial bodies in their multiform orbits and graded speeds is cited as an evidence of God\u2019s planning and creativeness. In accordance with this interpretation, the participle an-nazi\u2019at occurring in the first verse denotes the daily \u201cascending\u201d or \u201crising\u201d of the stars, while their subsequent \u201csetting\u201d is indicated by the expression gharqan, which comprises the two concepts of \u201cdrowning\u201d (i.e., disappearing) and, tropically, of the \u201ccompleteness\u201d of this daily phenomenon (Zamakhshari).",31],[79,2,1,"1. Or draw forth with drawing forth. Arabic: nashi\u1e6da. This root occurs only in this verse, so there is nothing to cross-reference with. Wehr (p. 1133) lists values including: to be lively; to be energetic. Lane (p. 2857) includes the value preferred by translators: to draw forth (i.e. like a bucket from the well). I have deferred to this reading, although I cannot tell whether the value is genuine, or an interpretative development based on common understandings of this context. N. J. Dawood renders: and those who gently release them; A. J. Arberry: and those that draw out violently; Muhammad Asad: and move [in their orbits] with steady motion; Hilali & Khan: By those (angels) who gently take out (the souls of the believers).",39],[79,3,1,"1.

Hence, the tabi\u2019i \u2018Ikrimah (as quoted by Razi) equates tasnim with tashrif, \u201cthat which is ennobling\u201d or \u201cexalting\u201d.",26],[83,28,1,"1.

The Traditionalist has some stories which he connects with these verses to derive particular meanings. I ignore them on the basis that whatever lessons we need to take from the Qur\u2019an are found within it. Muhammad Asad here, as so often, provides an oasis of sanity and sense in a desert of intellectual torpidity and imitation: Lit., \u201cthose responsible (ashab) for the pit of fire abounding in fuel\u201d. In order to explain this parabolic passage, the commentators interpret it - quite unnecessarily - in the past tense, and advance the most contradictory legends meant to \u201cidentify\u201d those evildoers in historical terms. The result is a medley of stories ranging from Abraham\u2019s experiences with his idolatrous contemporaries (cf. 21:68-70) to the Biblical legend of Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s attempt to burn three pious Israelites in a fiery furnace (The Book of Daniel iii, 19 ff.), or the persecution, in the sixth century, of the Christians of Najran by the King of Yemen, Dhu Nawas (who was a Jew by religion), or the entirely apocryphal story of a Zoroastrian king who burnt to death those of his subjects who refused to accept his dictum that a marriage of brother and sister was \u201cpermitted by God\u201d; and so forth. None of these legends needs, of course, to be seriously considered in this context. As a matter of fact, the very anonymity of the evildoers referred to in the above Qur\u2019anic passage shows that we have here a parable and not an allusion to \u201chistorical\u201d or even legendary events. The persecutors are people who, having no faith whatsoever, hate to see faith in others (see verse 8 below); the \u201cpit of fire\u201d is a metaphor for the persecution of the latter by the former: a phenomenon not restricted to any particular time or to a particular people but recurring in many forms and in varying degrees of intensity throughout recorded history.",40],[85,7,1,"1.

However, I include Muhammad Asad\u2019s comment here for interest: Some commentators assume that what is described here as at-tariq (\u201cthat which comes in the night\u201d) is the morning-star, because it appears towards the end of the night; others - like Zamakhshari or Raghib - understand by it \u201cthe star\u201d in its generic sense. Now if we analyze the origin of this noun, we find that it is derived from the verb taraqa, which primarily means \u201che beat [something]\u201d or \u201cknocked [at something]\u201d; hence, taraqa \u2018l-bab, \u201che knocked at the door\u201d. Tropically, the noun signifies \u201canything [or \u201canyone\u201d] that comes in the night\u201d, because a person who comes to a house by night is expected to knock at the door (Taj al-\u2019Arus). In the Qur\u2019anic mode of expression, at-tariq is evidently a metaphor for the heavenly solace which sometimes comes to a human being lost in the deepest darkness of affliction and distress; or for the sudden, intuitive enlightenment which disperses the darkness of uncertainty; or, finally, for divine revelation, which knocks, as it were, at the doors of man\u2019s heart... and thus fulfils the functions of both solace and enlightenment.",53],[86,7,1,"1. Arabic: tar\u0101\u2019ib. The lexicons I consulted have breast-bones or (higher) ribs. Of note is the fact that tar\u0101\u2019ib shares a root with tur\u0101b (dust) from which man is made (3:59). The rendering I have used here is found in the least sectarian lexicons, and is used by A. J. Arberry. I include Muhammad Asad\u2019s comment for interest: The plural noun tara\u2019ib, rendered by me as \u201cpelvic arch\u201d, has also the meaning of \u201cribs\u201d or \u201carch of bones\u201d; according to most of the authorities who have specialized in the etymology of rare Quranic expressions this term relates specifically to female anatomy (Taj al-\u2019Arus).",58],[86,11,1,"1.

See also 23:41.",40],[87,6,1,"1. See latter part of following note.",52],[87,7,1,"1. Muhammad Asad comments here: The classical commentators assume that the above words are addressed specifically to the Prophet, and that, therefore, they relate to his being taught the Qur\u2019an and being promised that he would not forget anything thereof, \u201csave what God may will [thee to forget]\u201d. This last clause has ever since given much trouble to the commentators, inasmuch as it is not very plausible that He who has revealed the Qur\u2019an to the Prophet should cause him to forget anything of it. Hence, many unconvincing explanations have been advanced from very early times down to our own days, the least convincing being that last refuge of every perplexed Qur\u2019an-commentator, the \u201cdoctrine of abrogation\u201d. However, the supposed difficulty of interpretation disappears as soon as we allow ourselves to realize that the above passage, though ostensibly addressed to the Prophet, is directed at man in general[...]. My own view is that the case is simpler: the classical commentators have not sufficiently embraced the Qur\u2019an\u2019s use of implicit punctuation (i.e. how certain portions of the text cry out that they are asides and should be regarded as parenthetical); thus, this clause relates to the climax of 87:2-5 above. The outline of stages of growth such as we see at 87:2-5 is quite a common one (cf. 22:5, 23:14-15, 40:67), and the implication in such cases is that the continuance or completion of such growth or progression is contingent upon the will of God \u2014 a point stated explicitly here. The clause in parenthesis at 87:6 is merely a precursor to the only place in the Qur\u2019an where the Prophet is told personally (i.e. in the second person singular imperative) to recite (Arabic root: q-r-\u2019) \u2014 which occurs in chapter 96. This is another nail in the coffin of the Traditionalist\u2019s stock of fictions which holds that the ninety-sixth chapter was the first revelation Mu\u1e25ammad received. On the basis of the internal Qur\u2019anic evidence that view is unsustainable since 87:6 must have preceded chapter 96. The instance of the form IV of the same verb which means to make recite found here at 87:6 is the only one in the text.",26],[87,15,1,"1. Arabic root: \u1e63-l-w; i.e. to do such duty as is incumbent. See note to 2:3 and Article SZC. Generically, \u1e63all\u0101 means to perform duty.

Cf. 75:31 and note thereto.",57],[87,16,1,"1. Arabic: bal. See note to 2:88.",13],[87,19,1,"1. See 53:36-57.",36],[88,1,1,"1.

See Notepad XIV.",18],[89,1,1,"1. I take this to refer to the beginning of the day which opens upon those peoples who rejected God and his messengers and were destroyed (see below).",12],[89,2,1,"1. The Traditionalist has some stories he prefers here rather than to apply himself to the Qur\u2019an. I am not interested in his stories and limit myself to the Qur\u2019an, Arabic, real history, and the application of reason. The question at 89:5 is a challenge to think \u2014 and clearly indicates for whom what follows is intended; so let us presume to apply intelligence. This form (i.e. the plural form of night: lay\u0101l) occurs only four times (19:10, 34:18, 69:7 and here at 89:2). At 19:10 it says \u2018Thy proof is that thou shalt not speak to men three nights being sound\u2019. At 69:7 it says: \u2018Which he compelled against them seven nights[...]\u2019. If we take the three nights of 19:10 and the seven nights of 69:7 we have the ten nights of 89:2. The verse at 34:18 has no mention of number and simply states nights, and itself serves to connect this part of the riddle with the next (see note on travel by night below).",15],[89,4,1,"1. Or it, however I think he is what is meant. See note to travel by night below",21],[89,4,2,"2. This form I verb means to travel by night or depart by night. The instances where travelling or departing at night are portrayed in the Qur\u2019an by means of this verb in this form all treat of destruction for the rejecters: 11:81, 15:65 (L\u016b\u1e6d leaving his city prior to destruction), 20:77, 26:52, 44:23 (M\u016bs\u0101 crossing water prior to the destruction of Fir\u02bfawn), and 34:18 (the people of Saba\u2019 allowed the chance to travel by day and night prior to their destruction). Thus, there is a total of six instances (even number) treating of a total of three scenarios (odd number).The narrative then picks up at 89:6-13 with reminders of those whom God destroyed.",31],[89,5,1,"1.

Arabic: sajada. See Notepad IV.",42],[97,1,1,"1. I.e. the Qur\u2019an. For why we know the Qur\u2019an to be the reference see note to 6:92. There is much to unpack in this chapter. The first question here is: what is sent down? The Traditionalist asserts that the pronoun object refers to revelation, his view being confirmed as the correct one (albeit for reasons other than those he typically offers). In treating the Traditionalist\u2019s existing presentation, we must address 44:3-4 where some see a foreshadowing of, or reference to, what we have here at chapter 97, namely, layla al qadr \u2014 the value of which such people assume to be the night of divine decree in which all affairs are destined for the year ahead, an assumption based entirely on sources other than the Qur\u2019an (for more on which see notes below). Verses 44:3-4 read: \u201cWe sent it down on a blessed night, \u2014 We are warning \u2014 Wherein is separated every wise command\u201d; the context there indisputably treats, at least to some degree, of revelation (see 44:2); moreover, we agree with the Traditionalist that it is only reasonable that the same is the case here at chapter 97: that which is referenced by \u2018it\u2019 is, likewise, revelation. However, at chapter 44, the Traditionalist tends to concentrate on the sending down of the revelation to Mu\u1e25ammad as a special, private event focused on the Prophet himself, and he leverages and extends that assumption in order to inform the sense one is to derive under his guidance here at chapter 97 \u2014 and it is this aspect of this topic we now wish to address. To the extent that the revelation of God reaches those men who are not prophets, God \u2018sent it down\u2019 to them also (albeit in a general and more diffused sense \u2014 a sense which the Traditionalist also accepts where it suits him) and it must be this broader, more general sense which is implied in 44:3-4 since the following context (in fact, the entire chapter) treats of warning \u2014 that is: the emphasis throughout is not on the private receipt of revelation from God by the Prophet, but on the delivery of that revelation to people more generally. If we are to claim a correlation between 44:3-4 and chapter 97 \u2014 and the Traditionalist does \u2014 on the strength of the similarities in their references to God sending down revelation on a particular night (and I certainly accept that correlation) then we should insist upon equivalence between the two segments: if receipt of revelation (whether heeded or not) by the generality of men (rather than an initial, private receipt by the Prophet) be accepted as operative in the first case, it should be accepted in like manner in the second case also.",10],[97,1,2,"2. The etymological options available to the Arabic qadr (often rendered here divine decree) may be gathered into five general groupings, which are separated by semi-colons: extent, scope, quantity, amount, scale, rate, measure, number; sum, amount; degree, grade; worth, standing, value, rank; divine decree. My opinion is that the sense of divine decree is a lexical development originating in another place. Be that as it may, it is certainly the case that such a value for qadr occurs nowhere outside of the present chapter, even according to the Traditionalist\u2019s own assessment. In order to find which of the remaining semantic groupings is referenced here, we should look to all remaining instances of qadr in the text (6:91, 22:74, 39:67, 65:3). We find that at 6:91, 22:74 and 39:67 qadr means measure in the sense of appraisal or estimation (\u201cand they measured God not with the measure due Him...\u201d). In the sole remaining case outside the present chapter the context is also that of extent or measure (the limits of God at 65:1, and [waiting] term at 65:2.). Thus in all cases outside the present chapter, measure or extent is either the explicit sense, the dominant context, or both. I must, therefore, assume it to be the sense here also. Since at 6:91, 22:74 and 39:67 the connotation of measure implied is that of appraisal or determination (in the sense of evaluation), this is the value I identify and use here. The question remains as to who the active agent is in the determination on such a night: God or man. The Traditionalist assumes the former (typically, that God is referenced here, seen as establishing his decree on this special night over all affairs for the coming year). However, this is an assumption, and one for which one can point to no explicit Qur\u2019anic support. The only other place at which the construction night + definite article + noun occurs in the Qur\u2019anic text is at 2:187 (\u201cOn the night of the fast\u201d); the active agents \u2014 i.e. the doers of the noun value \u2014 in that case are men (for it is not God who fasts but men). If we are interested in consistency \u2014 and the Qur\u2019an cites consistency in support of its claim to originate with God \u2014 we should incline to the view that the operation of \u201cal qadr\u201d here pertains, likewise, primarily to men rather than to God (although, naturally, in both cases \u2014 that of determination as here and of fasting as at 2:187 \u2014 God is the ultimate instigator, witness, and giver of reward). The above points accepted, the import of this collocation here is that God sent down the Qur\u2019an on the night on which men are \u2014 or were \u2014 to make a determination, evaluation or assessment; but a determination, evaluation or assessment of what? The key to this question is grasped by understanding the full sense of the word sal\u0101m as found at 97:5 (for which see notes thereto) as well as the points covered in the remainder of the notes to this chapter. However, in summary: the believers are to form a determination of the hearers (to decide whether they be friends, believers, rejecters, ignorant ones, etc.) based upon the hearers\u2019 own determination of that portion of the Qur\u2019an recited to them by the believers. Additional contextual and linguistic support for the points found in this note will be gained by reading 74:18-25.",47],[97,2,1,"1. The formulation here is telling. The convention \u2018And what will convey to thee...?\u2019 always indicates something which Mu\u1e25ammad is not expected to understand, and for which there follows an explanation (69:3, 74:27, 77:14, 82:17, 82:18, 83:8, 83:19, 86:2, 90:12, 97:2, 101:3, 101:10, 104:5). Such is the case here; thus, at 97:2 the Qur\u2019an presents a Mu\u1e25ammad ignorant of the meaning of layla al qadr \u2014 a point which contrasts starkly with the \u1e25ad\u012bth literature, which ascribes to Mu\u1e25ammad here \u2014 as so often \u2014 knowledge the Qur\u2019an denies him. The \u1e25ad\u012bth literature has Muslims looking for a special night in the hopes of gaining some uncommon access to God who, on the correct night \u2014 so it is claimed \u2014 determines all affairs for the year ahead. Such exegesis supplies superficial but Qur\u2019anically unfounded support to those who are temperamentally inclined to abdicate personal responsibility to do so. Thus, they can refuse to correlate the results of their lives with their actions, and look rather for benefit to particular times \u2014 instead of to the observation of the extant and operative laws of God \u2014 which practice is properly regarded as a form of polytheism.",64],[97,3,1,"1. Arabic: shahr \u2014 moon, month. A thousand months is equal to just over 83 solar years \u2014 a long life by any reckoning. Thus \u2018the Night of Determination\u2019 is better than a long life \u2014 and as the second clause of 97:4 shows \u2014 no matter how spent.",59],[97,4,1,"1. Having properly understood and parsed the rest of the chapter the present clause falls naturally into a nested parenthetical statement; thus, on \u2018the Night of Determination\u2019 it is \u2018by the leave of their Lord\u2019 (i.e. by the leave of the Lord of those who make the determination or, possibly, the Lord of the angels and the Spirit themselves) that the angels and the Spirit descend \u2014 and not because one happened rightly to guess at and observe a particular night, one whose expectation is drawn from an entirely different literature and whose characteristics require (in order for such a phenomenon to seem to be discerned within the Qur\u2019an) the mangling of Arabic usage in the local context out of all alignment with those senses established throughout the corpus (for more see notes below).",69],[97,4,2,"2. Arabic: min kulli. See note to 2:164.",87],[97,4,3,"3. The translators render min kulli here as [...]on every (errand) or [...]with each (decree). Nowhere in the remaining 44 instances of min kulli in the Qur\u2019an do we find anything close to such a value. The task in hand is not to try to bend the Qur\u2019an to what one\u2019s favourite school of \u2018Islam\u2019 has constructed on the basis of the \u1e25ad\u012bth, but to seek coherence and sense within the integrity of the Qur\u2019an\u2019s own fabric. On such a basis, min kulli can only mean every sort of, of every, among every or from (among) every. And \u2018amr means command, matter or affair. By treating the phrase above as a nested statement (see note thereto) and min kulli in accordance with its commonest pan-textual value (for more see note to 2:164) the sense becomes The Night of the Determination is better than a thousand months[...] of every sort of affair \u2014 the import of the second part of this statement being: no matter how lived, or of any type whatsoever.",99],[97,5,1,"1. Arabic: sal\u0101m \u2014 soundness, well-being; peace, peacefulness; safety, security. Contextual comparison of all instances of sal\u0101m as found here (i.e. without following modifiers such as \u2018be unto you\u2019) outside the present one (10:10, 11:69, 11:69, 14:23, 15:52, 33:44, 36:58, 43:89, 51:25, 51:25, 56:26, 56:26, 56:91) reveals this convention to possess the following applications: 1. as a general greeting (for persons either known or not known); 2. as a means of respectfully extricating oneself from interaction with those who are either ignorant or who reject faith; 3. God\u2019s greeting to the believers (specifically, upon their being received into the joys of the Fuller Life). The first two applications are fully consonant with the present context as understood and expounded upon here, and the third is aptly and beautifully prefigured (see also note below).",8],[97,5,2,"2. Grammar: feminine pronoun agreeing with night. Based on the totality of my investigations \u2014 the results of which comprise this translation and the notes thereto \u2014 the collocation \u2018the Night of Determination\u2019 is a function of what is identified in the broader work as \u2018the Submission\u2019 (Arabic: al suj\u016bd), i.e. that night vigil to which others are invited to hear the word of God (see Notepad XXI; cf. 48:29, 50:40, 68:42, 68:43) the chapters for which comprise a subset of the Qur\u2019an (and of which subset the present chapter forms part of the closing section); on \u2018the Night of Determination\u2019 men make their determinations: some among those outside the fold of believers accept, and others reject; meanwhile, believers themselves make their determinations concerning those to whom the words of God have been recited, whether they should be regarded as believers, rejecters, friends or ones lost in ignorance.

Translated often as time and also as afternoon, such renderings deprive the reader in English of a crucial point. A wider acquaintance with Arabic reveals that \u02bfa\u1e63r is used for age (as in Ice Age, Bronze Age, etc.), and epoch, and period. That is, \u02bfa\u1e63r denotes a span of time, time with a beginning and an end. Both time and afternoon have some connection with this most important point rattling about in them somewhere, but to render thus in English excludes the reader from the core point. The salient sense here is a span of time (i.e. a period with a beginning and an end), not simply time as an open-ended concept, or as something which happens after lunch. Muhammad Asad has a similar perspective and renders this word: the flight of time, and supplies the following comment: The term \u201casr denotes \u201ctime\u201d that is measurable, consisting of a succession of periods (in distinction from dahr, which signifies \u201cunlimited time\u201d, without beginning or end: i.e., \u201ctime absolute\u201d). Hence, asr bears the connotation of the passing or the flight of time - time which can never be recaptured.",20],[103,3,1,"1. Arabic: alladh\u012bna \u0101man\u016b.

The Traditionalist has some fanciful ideas about this chapter whose origins have no Qur\u2019anic basis, and which posit that f\u012bl here means elephant. It is true that one of the meanings of f\u012bl is elephant. However, f\u012bl also means base, weak; a man weak in judgment or opinion; ignoble; (see Lane, p. 2529). For those interested in the Qur\u2019an rather than in hearsay, the following points are worth noting: firstly, this instance of f\u012bl is the only one in the Qur\u2019an, so there is nothing to cross-reference the word with; secondly, we find in this chapter \u1e25ij\u0101rati min sijj\u012bl which means \u2014 and is rendered as \u2014 stones of baked clay. This exact expression occurs twice more (at 11:82 and 15:74) and in both instances unequivocally references the people of L\u016b\u1e6d. We also know that the people of L\u016b\u1e6d are described as lacking \u2018a right-minded man\u2019 among them (11:78). Thus, if we are to judge this chapter on the basis of the Qur\u2019anic evidence as opposed to something else, al f\u012bl denotes one weak in judgment, base, weak, ignoble \u2014 which we should correlate with an inhabitant of the city of L\u016b\u1e6d.",88],[105,2,1,"1. Given our identification of this as a reference the inhabitants of the city of L\u016b\u1e6d (see note to 105:1), this statement is demonstrably correct within the bounds of the Qur\u2019anic narrative: God frustrated the people of L\u016b\u1e6d in their designs against him and his guests.",37],[105,3,1,"1.

The Traditionalist claims 106:1 to refer to the tribe known as Quraysh and 106:3 to a house used during pilgrimage. He may be right; I really cannot say with certainty. And nor can he \u2014 at least not on the basis of the Qur\u2019an. Certainly the Arabs made pilgrimage to Petra; according to Dan Gibson\u2019s work (Quranic Geography, 2011), no such evidence exists for Mecca until well after the Qur\u2019anic revelation. Today, Petra is a ruin and its interest merely historical; in any case the point is moot (see note to 9:28 and Notepad XVI). The text does not say serve the lord at this house, it says serve the lord of this house. One can do that anywhere. Whether the Quraysh tribe pre-existed the Qur\u2019anic revelation or was concocted along with the \u1e25ad\u012bth literature afterwards in order to benefit certain people is a question which requires objective historical investigation. We do know that various groups claimed to be Sabaeans in order to garner privileges under Muslim kings and priesthoods, and that there are countless millions more in the world today who claim direct descent from the Prophet than can genuinely be the case. Such points are of anthropological, social, and political interest but do not have a direct bearing on the chapter in question. What was of more immediate interest to me is the fact that quraysh means shark (Blackwell Companion to the Qur\u2019an, p. 130, Michael Carter, contributor, writes concerning the foreign source of certain words: \u2018It is only the word quraysh \u201cshark\u201d which is traced to Greek [via Syriac][...]\u2019) and that, as recently as the 1980s, it was discovered that many sharks migrate \u2014 travelling great distances across oceans in summer and winter \u2014 to feed or reproduce; prior to that it was believed that they lived regionally. Lastly, bayt \u2014 rendered here house \u2014 also means family. While it is not a point of doctrine with me, I entertain the idea that what is meant is the family (in the generic sense of species) of the shark. Such thoughts \u2014 as with the Traditionalist\u2019s assertions on this point \u2014 are purely speculative, and God knows best.",39],[106,2,1,"1. Arabic: ri\u1e25la \u2014 journey, travel, trip, tour. This word is frequently bent into caravan by Traditionalist translators to make it comport with expectations derived from other sources.

What God gave the Prophet in abundance was that revelation contained in the Qur\u2019an. It is my opinion that this chapter serves to encourage the Messenger (and those who would follow him) to share this revelation with others. See end of Article MLQ.",24],[108,2,2,"2. Arabic: na\u1e25ara. This root occurs only once, which fact makes it vulnerable to corruption by interested parties. This form I verb has come to mean to slaughter, to butcher and it is claimed in the sense of to sacrifice, generally speaking, by the Traditionalist in support of one of his favourite pastimes: killing things. I argue that this meaning has attached itself over time. The concept of animal sacrifice is demonstrably alien to the Qur\u2019an as we see \u2018[...]Their flesh does not reach God, nor their blood. But prudent fear reaches Him from you[...]\u2019 (22:37). These values at 22:37 are uncontested and fully supported pan-textually. On that basis, it is impossible to consider slaughter or sacrifice the meaning at 108:2 because the text reads \u2018to thy Lord\u2019 (which is a natural object for both imperatives in the verse \u2014 and the Traditionalist himself typically assumes as much). But God cannot expect one to sacrifice to Him that which He has told us does not reach Him. We must, if we are to be intellectually honest and consistent, look to other accepted meanings for na\u1e25ara. It has two: to master (superlatively) (Lane, p. 2835); and to do something as soon as it becomes due (meanings which both Lane and Badawi-Haleem include). Since to my mind, if one has fully mastered something one does it in a timely manner, I feel that to master includes within it mastery of time as a given, and I render on that basis.",63],[109,1,1,"1. Arabic: al k\u0101fir\u016bn. See note to 2:19 and Notepad II.iii. This is the only instance where this category of person is addressed directly (i.e. in the vocative). This chapter is typically understood \u2014 and thus rendered in translation \u2014 in a way which strikes a sadly mistaken tone. The dominant assumption \u2014 given a wrong value for al k\u0101fir\u016bn \u2013 is that those addressed are \u2018unbelievers\u2019 (i.e. a fundamentally distinct group; one possessed of a wildly different set of beliefs to those held by believers) and that God is directing the Messenger to say something along the lines of: you and I have different doctrines, so let\u2019s just accept the fact. But this is not exactly what is being said. The function of the chapter is to distance the speaker (one who truly believes and whose actions issue forth from that fact) from a group which wears the garb of faith \u2014 that is, from people who put themselves about as believers but whose actions are not commensurate with their claims. Thus, this chapter is making a point entirely different to the one claimed by the Traditionalist; namely: that religion you have \u2014 that which simulates virtue but which rejects the requisite guidance virtue demands \u2014 that is not what I believe (no matter how much you might like to have it otherwise).",44],[109,6,1,"1.

The feminine gender of naffathat does not, as Zamakhshari and Razi point out, necessarily indicate \u201cwomen\u201d, but may well relate to \u201chuman beings\u201d (anfus, sing. nafs, a noun that is grammatically feminine).\u2019",43],[114,4,1,"1.
